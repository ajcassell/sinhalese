1. In the semi.vpm file, we removed the PNG and E that preceded the header text on
the external side (i.e. : E.TENSE => Tense). We removed gender completely from the file
and changed the default mood to indicative. Indicative is regularly used with our verbs
and therefore we thought it was best as the default. Since only two of our testsuite
examples have aspect, we changed our aspect to no aspect. Under tense, we added a hyphen
on the external side for non-past, as discussed in lecture. We also added an additional
property to map present tense, which is not a tense in Sinhala, to nonpast tense in Sinhala.
Under PER and NUM, we simply changed the external side. For example, 3rd <> 3rd became
3rd <> third and plural <> plural became plural <> pl. Sinhala does not have a combined
PERNUM feature. The only other semantic feature we have is a DEF feature, but we did not add
it as discussed on Canvas.

In order to remove errors in translating, we commented out items in the lexicon and in sinhalese.tdl.
In sinhalese.tdl, we commented out both completive and perfective aspects and the future-aux-aux-lex
rule. Since we changed the aspect in semi.vpm to no aspect, the existence of future-aux-aux-lex caused
issues with translation, and we thought it best to commment it out. As a result, in the lexicon, we
commented out the auxiliary "daa", since removing the future-aux-aux-lex rule created another error.
"Daa" is not used in our sin.txt file and it is only used for a single testsuite sentence.

For sin sin translations, as well as sje sin and eng sin, we started with 450 translations
for sentence 1 with the Lab 5 grammar. After editing the semi.vpm file, this brought the
number of translations down to 162, a significant difference from the lab prior!



Wh Questions:

In Sinhala,  Wh questions are always accompanied by 'd2', a question marker. Wh words, such as ‘Kohe-d2’ (where),
‘kau-d2’ (who), and 'mon2wa-d2' must have the question marker attached for a sentence to be grammatical. Interrogative
words also require the verb be in focus form, which means the focus marker ‘-e’ is added to the verbal predicate to
reflect a focused sentence pattern. Sinhala uses focus to signal the addressee to focus attention on the referent.
Interrogative words are considered an inherently focused constituent, therefore Sinhala uses focus markers on the
verbal predicate in wh questions. Focus form also appears in other contexts such as yes/no questions, negation, aspect,
clauses, and more. Interrogative words are generally sentence-initial, but Sinhala’s free word order allows for optional
movement.

INSERT IGT/testable sentences



In the customizaton system, we edited the constituent (wh-) questions section. We stated that all questions phrases can
be fronted and that fronting is also optional. We left pied piping empty, as we do not have any evidence this occurs. We
also did not check any of the options under "other choices". We added wh words as a noun type called wh-pronouns and
combined the wh word and the question marker as mentioned on canvas. "kau-d2" is now reflected as "kaud2". We also changed
the predicates to reflect "_person_n_rel", "_thing_n_rel", and  "_place_n_rel". For the focus form of the verbal predicate,

MMT Issues:

Coordination:

We are still having issues with coordination following Thursday's debugging. We have been testing with
sentence 8, shown below. Sin to sin translation still results in 0 translated sentences as it still
terminates the search due to too much RAM. The  output states 3779 passive, 17472 edges with 0/2
sentences generated. In the lkb, the sentence parses, but there are 0 realizations when we attempt
generation.

Sentence 8: puusa-o i ball-o i kaar-n bal2-n2-wa

Of Note, sentences 9 and 10 will not parse or translate because of how our grammar is set up. We previously
had a coordination strategy targeting regualar VP coordination, but it caused so many additional parses
for other sentences that we decided to remove it. We are willing to add it back if there is a way to
restrict all other VPs from incorrectly attempting coordination.

Other MMT Notes:
Sentence 7, 22, 23, 24 - We have not implemented interrogative complements.
