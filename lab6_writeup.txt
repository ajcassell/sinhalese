1. In the semi.vpm file, we removed the PNG and E that preceded the header text on
the external side (i.e. : E.TENSE => Tense). We removed gender completely from the file
and changed the default mood to indicative. Indicative is regularly used with our verbs
and therefore we thought it was best as the default. Since only two of our testsuite
examples have aspect, we changed our aspect to no aspect. Under tense, we added a hyphen
on the external side for non-past, as discussed in lecture. We also added an additional
property to map present tense, which is not a tense in Sinhala, to nonpast tense in Sinhala.
Under PER and NUM, we simply changed the external side. For example, 3rd <> 3rd became
3rd <> third and plural <> plural became plural <> pl. Sinhala does not have a combined
PERNUM feature. The only other semantic feature we have is a DEF feature, but we did not add
it as discussed on Canvas. Defaults for CASE have not been implemented yet, as requested.

In order to remove errors in translating, we commented out items in the lexicon and in sinhalese.tdl.
In sinhalese.tdl, we commented out both completive and perfective aspects and the future-aux-aux-lex
rule. Since we changed the aspect in semi.vpm to no aspect, the existence of future-aux-aux-lex caused
issues with translation, and we thought it best to comment it out. As a result, in the lexicon, we
commented out the auxiliary "daa", since removing the future-aux-aux-lex rule created another error.
"Daa" is not used in our sin.txt file and it is only used for a single testsuite sentence.

;

For sin sin translations, as well as sje sin and eng sin, we started with 450 translations
for sentence 1 with the Lab 5 grammar. After editing the semi.vpm file, this brought the
number of translations down to 162, a significant difference from the lab prior (stay tuned
for more refinement)!

In addition to the semi.vpm file, we also included these three trigger rules
for our 2 complementizers and our clitic that were giving warnings when
loading the grammar:

i1_nosem_gr := generator_rule &
  [ CONTEXT.RELS.LIST < [ PRED "_and_coord_rel" ] >,
    FLAGS.TRIGGER "i1_nosem" ].

comp_gtr := generator_rule &
[ CONTEXT [ RELS <! [ ARG0 #e & [ SF prop ]] !> ],
  FLAGS [ EQUAL < #e >,
          TRIGGER "baw2" ]].

comp2_gtr := generator_rule &
[ CONTEXT [ RELS <! [ ARG0 #e & [ SF prop ]] !> ],
  FLAGS [ EQUAL < #e >,
          TRIGGER "ki2la" ]].

2. We started with a lot of morphology cleanup, most of which included
removing unnecessary extra affixing lexical rules. These were present
in two instances. There were multiple possible affixes (according
to our sources) for the same lexical rule (i.e. -a or -aa for masc.sg nouns)
and in some cases we were not using one so it could be removed and in other
cases we had instances of both but switched over to one option only.

The rules with affixes that we removed are:
- anim masc sg -aa
- anim pl -u and -laa
- inanim pl -wal
- genitive -generate
- NPT tense -nn
- INDEF -ak for nouns and determiners

There were also two types we removed:
- irreg-plural nouns
- indef-plural nouns
These were leftover from week 1 when we weren't sure how to do morphology
correctly for this course and had groupings of "irregular" words that behaved
differently. Now we moved those nouns into the correct noun classes.

Essentially we had way too many morphological options that caused a LOT
of generations and clouded our results.

A lot of parses were showing issues with NARROWED-FOCUS constituents appearing
in places that they shouldn't. We think that we were not using the choices
in the customization system correctly. So we cleared that from the grammar
and just maintained the FOCUS lexical rule in the mood-pc and this ties in with
the [ FORM focusform ] mentioned later with respect to wh-questions.

We also updated all of our pronouns to have the correct PRED, as requested,
for example:
ma := 1sg-pronoun-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "ma" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

These changes brought our metrics to:
Coverage: 63.4%
Overgeneration: 10.8%
Average distinct analyses: 11.43%
which are not far from the original results, BUT the number of parses
for some of our sentence such as conjunctive coordination dropped
significantly from 232 to 82.

`The teachers, parents and children watch the road`

We made significant other changes in TDL as well.
First,

Wh Questions:

In Sinhala,  Wh questions are always accompanied by 'd2', a question marker. Wh words, such as ‘kohe-d2’ (where),
‘kau-d2’ (who), and 'mon2wa-d2' must have the question marker attached for a sentence to be grammatical. Interrogative
words also require the verb be in focus form, which means the focus marker ‘-e’ is added to the verbal predicate to
reflect a focused sentence pattern. Sinhala uses focus to signal the addressee to focus attention on the referent.
Interrogative words are considered an inherently focused constituent, therefore Sinhala uses focus markers on the
verbal predicate in wh questions. Focus form also appears in other contexts such as yes/no questions, negation, aspect,
clauses, and more. Interrogative words are generally sentence-initial, but Sinhala’s free word order allows for optional
movement.

In the customizaton system, we edited the constituent (wh-) questions section. We stated that all questions phrases can
be fronted and that fronting is also optional. We left pied piping empty, as we do not have any evidence this occurs. We
also did not check any of the options under "other choices". We added wh words as a noun type called wh-pronouns and
combined the wh word and the question marker as mentioned on canvas. "kau-d2" is now reflected as "kaud2". We also changed
the predicates to reflect "_person_n_rel", "_thing_n_rel", and  "_place_n_rel". For the focus form of the verbal predicate,

We noticed that the choices we made with respect to focus in the customization
system during a previous lab was interfering with our results - parses
were happening with NARROWED-FOCUS in places they shouldn't have and we came to
the assumption (via feedback) that perhaps we were using the focus information
structure page to do something more than what we were aiming to model
from our sources. To combat these extra parses, we got rid of the focus choices in
the information structure page. The use of focus for our testsuite and the
translation sentences is only in wh-questions and negation, so we just maintained
our lexical rule for focus in the mood-pc and in the TDL, we added a FORM type,
subtype of finite, such that the head-daughter of the
wh-ques rule requires [ FORM focusform ]. Our focus test sentences continue
to parse correctly.

Examples of WH-question with focus:

# 6 WH-question, with focus shift
Judgement: g
bat kanne kaud2
bat-2 ka-n2-e kaud2
rice.NOM-SG eat-NPT-FOC who.Q
`Who eats rice?`

# 7 WH-question, sentence-initial, with focus shift
Judgement: g
kaud2 bat kanne
kaud2 bat-2 ka-n2-e
who.Q rice.NOM-SG eat-NPT-FOC
`Who eats rice?`

An example that is not yet working is:
# 1 WH-question sentence-final, with focus shift
Judgement: g
mam2 yanne kohed2
ma-m2 ya-n2-e kohed2
1SG-NOM go-NPT-FOC where.Q
`Where do I go?`

It is only in the case of our WHERE.Q word and my assumption
is that this is due to WHERE semantics being related to the
either non-verbal predicates or dative clauses such as
"where is the dog"/"the dog is here" and
"where do I go?"/"I go TO the store". Do we need to
wait for those two things to be implemented for this to work?

The next thing we fixed in the TDL was to include the OPT variable in
our transitive verb lexical rules for case constraint because our
vol/invol obj1/obj2 rules were allowing all combinations, generating too
many parses. We added another rule in the obj-pc with [ OPT + ] on the object
and [ OPT - ] on all the other rules. When this didn't solve the problem,
we updated the TDL such that the comp-head rule requires [ OPT - ] on the
complement.

verb-pc9_lrt4_name=vol-obj-opt
  verb-pc9_lrt4_feat1_name=OPT
  verb-pc9_lrt4_feat1_value=plus
  verb-pc9_lrt4_feat1_head=obj
  verb-pc9_lrt4_lri1_inflecting=no

(the rest of those three pc rules have OPT minus)

We put the following in sinhalese.tdl near the definition of head-comp phrase.

basic-head-1st-comp-phrase :+
  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < [ OPT - ] > ].

Now this parses with less ambiguity:

kaddi bal2n2wa
ka-ddi bal2-n2-wa
eat-while read-NPT-IND
`While someone is eating, someone reads'

A lot of ambiguity remains here but we think it is do to word order and argument
optionality because the pronoun "ma-m2" can apply to either clause as the object
or subject.

# 1 Subordination via verb ending -ddi
Judgement: g
balla kaddi mam2 pot2 bal2n2wa
ball-a ka-ddi ma-m2 pot-2 bal2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG eat-while 1SG-NOM book-SG read-NPT-IND
`While the dog is eating, I read the book`

However, I'm a little confused by the PP consituent that is created for ka-ddi.

The last updates we worked on were improving coordination.
First we commented out coordination strategy #2 that was just for Ns, not NPs and
this did not affect our results.

Next, we wanted to incorporate our final coordination strategy which is
asyndetonic coordination of VPs in what our sources called "participle coordination".
This strategy is used to demonstrate a temporal relation of events.
We did this through TDL instead of the customization system, so we added:

vp3-top-coord-rule := basic-vp-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "3",
    LCOORD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM past-part ].

vp3-bottom-coord-rule := unary-bottom-coord-rule & vp-bottom-coord-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ COORD-STRAT "3",
                   COORD-REL.PRED "_and_coord_rel" ],
    NONCONJ-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM finite ].
to sinhalese.tdl and:

vp3-top-coord := vp3-top-coord-rule.
vp3-bottom-coord := vp3-bottom-coord-rule.

to rules.TDL. The non-final conjunct daughter (first) id FORM past-part and the
rest are FORM finite.

In the following example, the "going home" occurs and then the "eating food". Because
go is intransitive and the clause "go home" is more like a dative clause,
for syntactic testing purposes we replaced "ya-la" with "ka-la".

# Does not parse
Judgement: g
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla k55m2 k55wa
ma-m2 ged2r-2 ya-la k55m-2 ka-u-wa
1SG-NOM house.ACC-SG go-PP food.ACC-SG eat-PST-IND
`I went home and ate`

# Parses!
Judgement: g
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla k55m2 k55wa
ma-m2 ged2r-2 ka-la k55m-2 ka-u-wa
1SG-NOM house.ACC-SG eat-PP food.ACC-SG eat-PST-IND
`I ate home and ate`

Lastly, as a result of testing translations/generations, we found that our
coordination sentences struggled with memory. The cause of this was because
Sinhalese has multiple cases and genders, none of which were requirements in
NP agreement between coordinands, and so the tops of coordination rules
were left unspecified in case and gender and could thus combine with any and
all verb case constraints. We didn't see evidence of coordinand agreement in our sources
but to clean up this translation step, we made two changes:
a) the case is passed up from the non-conj daughter to the head.
b) "default" to animate GENDER for the
purposes of these test sentences being "dogs" and "cats".
The goal of these changes was to not leave these things unspecified at the top of the NP.

^ the following was then repeated for strategy # 2:

  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.CASE #case,
		   COORD-STRAT "2" ],
    NONCONJ-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.CASE #case ].

These updates brought the number of parses for the following
from 82 to 2! (already included as an example above)

# 2 Conjunctive coordination - clitic i between units of coordination
Judgement: g
guruw2rui demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 bal2n2wa
guruw2r-u i demaupiy-o i lam2in-u i paar-2 bal2-n2-wa
teacher-PL CONJ parent-PL CONJ child-PL CONJ road-SG watch-NPT-IND
`The teachers, parents and children watch the road`

MMT: We greatly improved the translations from last week. Sentence #1 started with 450
translations and is now down to 24. However, sentences 2 and 3 are at 144 and 600+ translations.
There still seems to be a lot of extra generations due to affixes that are NOT optional
being excluded in generations. For example, with sentence 3, we see two examples of this.

ma-m2 oyaa bal2-n2-wa
1sg-NOM 3SG watch-NPT-IND
"I watch you"

First, oyaala is present when it should be the singular oyaa and second,
there are many instances of the verb stem "bal2" alone when our grammar
requires the tense-pc to be indicated as an affix. So we need to do
more investigating into these issues.

On the other hand, sentence 20 is now at 18 translations eng->sin and sin->sin when it
was at 0 before all of our edits.

Coordination:

We are still having issues with coordination following Thursday's debugging (when we added
the coordinand agreement constraints to strategies 1 and 2). We have been testing with
sentence 8, shown below. Sin to sin translation still results in 0 translated sentences as it still
terminates the search due to too much RAM. The output states 3779 passive, 17472 edges with 0/2
sentences generated. In the lkb, the sentence parses, but there are 0 realizations when we attempt
generation. Sin->eng works but not sin->sin or eng->sin.

Sentence 8:
puusa-o i ball-o i kaar-n bal2-n2-wa
cat.NOM-PL and dog.NOM-PL and car.NOM-PL watch-NPT-IND
"The cats and dogs watch the car"

Of note, sentences 9 and 10 will not parse or translate because of how our grammar is set up. We previously
had a coordination strategy targeting asyndetonic VP coordination, but it caused so many additional parses
for other sentences that we decided to remove it. We are willing to add it back if there is a way to
restrict all other VPs from incorrectly attempting coordination (this is mentioned more below in #3).

Other MMT Notes:
Sentence 7, 22, 23, 24 - We have not yet implemented interrogative complements.

3. The initial metrics from our testsuite (from end of Lab 5) were:
Coverage: 63.4%
Overgeneration: 12.3%
Average Distinct Analyses: 10.25

Attempts to generate via mmt --> ran out of memory for most sentences

Final metrics from our testsuite as of today:
Coverage: 65.9% (81 results from 188)
Overgeneration: 16.9%
Average Distinct Analyses: 4.45

MMT -> some have improved and one still has memory issues (as discussed above)

Coverage increased as we are now able to parse our 2 wh-questions
and our participle conjuction example as well. In terms of
overgeneration, we introduced a few new ungrammatical parses such as:

# 9 Subordination without instrumental verb casing
Judgement: u
oyaa pot2 bal2wa mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa pot-2 bal2-u-wa ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM book-SG read-PST-IND 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you read the book`

This is technically syntactically grammatical because
it parses due to VP coordination (from our new
strategy 3) of "read book" and "clean I.NOM/'me'"
when semantically they are supposed to be related
via the adverbial modification of "because" which can
be the free morpheme hinda/nissa or nominalized casing
(which we chose to not focus on implementing).
The VP coordination does not show the cause and effect
of these two VPs. We had made the FORM requirements be
finite and past-part but neither of these verbs are
past-part. Sinhalese does in fact allow for VP coordination
that is asyndetonic but we have not implemented this because
it caused majorly excessive parses in all of our sentences
that contained more than one verb. We would like to find a way
to clean that up because it will also be needed in the translation
sentences.

At this point we have all of our major phenomena working
except for interrogative complement clauses. Our
remaining issues still have to do with too much ambiguity. For example,
our sentences that use free morpheme adverbial modifiers "hinda" and "nissa"
are creating 48 parses. This is our largest remaining ambiguity.

# 10 Subordination via particle hinda, NPT
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2 hinda mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat-2 ka-n2 hinda ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice-SG eat-NPT.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

Another note regarding ambiguity: we have commented out the
ex-adj, ex-subj, ex-comps rules that come from the wh-questions
implementation because they were causing many excess generations
which was confusing to us.

The sentences that are not parsing yet are still in high part due to
non-verbal predicates, dative "for/to NP", interrogative complement
clauses, and asyndetonic VP coordination.
