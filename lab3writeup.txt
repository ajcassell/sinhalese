Agreement in NP Coordination:
In Sinhala, NPs and NOMs are conjoined by a noun coordinating particle ‘i’, which is considered
a clitic in this context . Every item that enters coordination has ‘i’ affixed to the end of the
word. For consonant-final nouns, ‘u’ is added as an epenthetic vowel after the final consonant
but before the clitic. These are some examples representing both the clitic and epenthetic usage.

# 2 NP coordination, epenthetic vowel present following consonant-final noun
amma batui ge3i2i gatta
amma batu-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

#3 NP Coordination, incorrect missing junction vowel 'u' following final consonant on bat
amma bati ge3i2i gatta
amma bat-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

In the customization matrix, NP coordination is labelled omnisyndeton, since all coordinands
must have the clitic. We then chose the affix option with 'i' occuring after the
coordinand.


Attributive Adjectives:
Sinhala classifies adjectives into three classes: nominal, verbal, and descriptive.
Descriptive adjectives are the only adjectives considered to be pure adjectives, since nominal
and verbal adjectives have unclear boundaries and can appear identically to nouns and verbs.
Descriptive adjectives occurring attributively precede nouns and they are also divided into subclasses.
These subclasses include: qualitative, demonstrative, and quantitative adjectives. Quantitative
adjectives describe the quantity of a noun or descriptive adjective and include several subtypes:
cardinal numeral, indefinite numeral, and non-numeral adjectives. Cardinal numeral adjectives, except
‘ek2’ (one), follow the noun. ‘ek2’ can only precede a noun. Animacy determines whether a connective is
required with the numeral. Animate nouns required a numeral plus the connective, while inanimate nouns
do not require the connective. (52---not sure if I should keep this or what—there are not any solid
examples.) Indefinite numeral adjectives include: ‘sam2har2’ (some) and ‘okkoma2’ (all). Non-numeral
quantitative adjectives include examples such as 'loku wædi'(too big), which form adjectival phrases.
Sentences with this construction, as well as demonstrative adjectives, are not maximally simple sentences
for the purposes of our project. Adjectives do not agree in case, number, or gender, with the exception of
cardinal numeral adjectives as previously described.

# 1 Qualitative Adjective
loku balla bat kan2wa
loku balla bat ka-n2-wa
big dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The big dog eats rice`

# 4 Cardinal numeral adjective, cardinal 'one' preceding noun
mam2 ek2 pot2 gatta
ma-m2 ek2 pot2 gatta
I-NOM one book.SG buy.PST
`I bought one book`

# 6  Indefinite Adjective
sam2har2 guruw2ru kææwa
sam2har2 guruw2ru kææwa
some teachers.PL eat.PST
`Some teachers eat`

Non-Verbal Predicates:
In Sinhala, predicates are divided into two categories: verbal and non-verbal. In the non-verbal
category, non-verbal clauses are subdivided into equational and non-equational sentences. Equational
sentences include a topic (a nominal) and an adjectival or nominal predicate. The predicate describes
the topic’s quality, category, or characteristics. Non-equational sentences consist of NPs marked with
dative, genitive, ablative, or locative case as predicates. Non-verbal predicates do not require a copula
to combine the subject and the predicate. In adjectival predicates, an assertion mark ‘i’ is required for
vowel final adjectives when they appear as a predicate. This morpheme is not required when consonant-final
adjectives are the predicate or with negative forms.

# 3 Adjectival Predicate, with vowel-final adjective with assertion marker
bat rasai
bat rasa-i
rice delicious-AM
`The rice is delicious`

# 8 Nominal Predicate
eyaa guruw2r2ek
eyaa guruw2r2-ek
She/he teacher-INDF
`She is a teacher`

# 10 Non-Equational
bat mage
bat ma-ge
rice I-GEN
`The rice is mine
