Coordination:
In Sinhala, NPs and NOMs are conjoined by a noun coordinating particle ‘i’, which is considered
a clitic in this context . Every item that enters coordination has ‘i’ affixed to the end of the
word. For consonant-final nouns, ‘u’ is added as an epenthetic vowel after the final consonant
but before the clitic. These are some examples representing both the clitic and epenthetic usage.

# 2 NP coordination, epenthetic vowel present following consonant-final noun
amma batui ge3i2i gatta
amma batu-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

#3 NP Coordination, incorrect missing junction vowel 'u' following final consonant on bat
amma bati ge3i2i gatta
amma bat-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

In the customization matrix, we added three coordination strategies. Coordination strategy 1 corresponds
to noun coordination and is labelled omnisyndeton, since all coordinands
must have the clitic 'i'. We then chose the affix option with 'i' occuring after the
coordinand. Coordination Strategy 2 represents noun and NP coordiantion as polsyndeton. The word 'saha'
appears before every coordinand, except the first. Coordination strategy 3 corresponds to a asyndeton pattern
of noun and NP coordination.

Agreement in NP Coordination:
Sinhala does not have agreement in NP Coordination.

Attributive Adjectives:
Sinhala classifies adjectives into three classes: nominal, verbal, and descriptive.
Descriptive adjectives are the only adjectives considered to be pure adjectives, since nominal
and verbal adjectives have unclear boundaries and can appear identically to nouns and verbs.
Descriptive adjectives occurring attributively precede nouns and they are also divided into subclasses.
These subclasses include: qualitative, demonstrative, and quantitative adjectives. Quantitative
adjectives describe the quantity of a noun or descriptive adjective and include several subtypes:
cardinal numeral, indefinite numeral, and non-numeral adjectives. Cardinal numeral adjectives, except
‘ek2’ (one), follow the noun. ‘ek2’ can only precede a noun. Animacy determines whether a connective is
required with the numeral. Animate nouns required a numeral plus the connective, while inanimate nouns
do not require the connective. (52---not sure if I should keep this or what—there are not any solid
examples.) Indefinite numeral adjectives include: ‘sam2har2’ (some) and ‘okkoma2’ (all). Non-numeral
quantitative adjectives include examples such as 'loku wædi'(too big), which form adjectival phrases.
Sentences with this construction, as well as demonstrative adjectives, are not maximally simple sentences
for the purposes of our project. Adjectives do not agree in case, number, or gender, with the exception of
cardinal numeral adjectives as previously described.

# 1 Qualitative Adjective
loku balla bat kan2wa
loku balla bat ka-n2-wa
big dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The big dog eats rice`

# 4 Cardinal numeral adjective, cardinal 'one' preceding noun
mam2 ek2 pot2 gatta
ma-m2 ek2 pot2 gatta
I-NOM one book.SG buy.PST
`I bought one book`

# 6  Indefinite Adjective
sam2har2 guruw2ru kææwa
sam2har2 guruw2ru kææwa
some teachers.PL eat.PST
`Some teachers eat`

In the customization matrix, attributive adjectives were added with a type names of regular-attr
and cardinal-except-attr. Adjectives in cardinal-except-attr reflect how the adjective modifies items
immediately before the adjective. Attributive adjectives modify items immediately after the adjective.
We labelled these adjectives as attributive only, since we are not adding non-verbal predicates to
our starter grammar this week. These adjectives modify item immediately after the adjective.
Additionally, given we are skipping non-verbal predicates, we chose "impossibly" when asked about
adjective behaving predicatively and appearing as the complement of the copula.


Non-Verbal Predicates:
In Sinhala, predicates are divided into two categories: verbal and non-verbal. In the non-verbal
category, non-verbal clauses are subdivided into equational and non-equational sentences. Equational
sentences include a topic (a nominal) and an adjectival or nominal predicate. The predicate describes
the topic’s quality, category, or characteristics. Non-equational sentences consist of NPs marked with
dative, genitive, ablative, or locative case as predicates. Non-verbal predicates do not require a copula
to combine the subject and the predicate. In adjectival predicates, an assertion mark ‘i’ is required for
vowel final adjectives when they appear as a predicate. This morpheme is not required when consonant-final
adjectives are the predicate or with negative forms.

# 3 Adjectival Predicate, with vowel-final adjective with assertion marker
bat rasai
bat rasa-i
rice delicious-AM
`The rice is delicious`

# 8 Nominal Predicate
eyaa guruw2r2ek
eyaa guruw2r2-ek
She/he teacher-INDF
`She is a teacher`

# 10 Non-Equational
bat mage
bat ma-ge
rice I-GEN
`The rice is mine

This phenomena was not included in the starter grammar this week.


Customization System:

Tense and Aspect:

Sinhala has two tenses: past and non-past. In the matrix, we selected these two common hierarchy element and
added subtypes under past, which included perfect-participle and past-participle. While there are seven aspects
in Sinhala, we are only modeling perfective and completive in our grammar. We opted to create our own hierarchy
of values for aspect and added perfective and completive here.

Word Order:

In the word order section, we added auxiliary verbs. We specified that auxiliaries appear after the complement.
Auxiliary complements are VPs, raising subject and more than one auxiliary can be present in a clause. We did
have the auxiliary sectioned completed for Lab 2, but the auxiliary verb radio button was set to no.

Lexicon:

For auxiliary verbs, three auxiliary features were defined: neg, perf-part-aux, and future-aux. The neg auxiliary
type contributes an independent predicate and takes a noun phrase bearing the case the verbal complement assigns
to its subject as the subject type. We also added a complement feature with a value of finite, nonfinite. Perf-part-
aux is a perfect participle auxiliary that does not contribute a predicate. The subject type is a also a NP bearing
the case the verbal complement assigns to its subject. We added two complement features, one with a value of finite
nonfinite and the second is a tense feature with the value past. Lastly, the future-aux type does not contribute a
predicate and takes the same subject type as the prior auxiliary types. We added two complement features, including
one with finite/nonfinite values and the second as a tense feature with a nonpast value.

Adjectives were described above for the matrix.
