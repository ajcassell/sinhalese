Coordination:
In Sinhala, NPs and NOMs are conjoined by a noun coordinating particle ‘i’, which is considered
a clitic in this context . Every item that enters coordination has ‘i’ affixed to the end of the
word. For consonant-final nouns, ‘u’ is added as an epenthetic vowel after the final consonant
but before the clitic. These are some examples representing both the clitic and epenthetic usage.

# 2 NP coordination, epenthetic vowel present following consonant-final noun
amma batui ge3i2i gatta
amma batu-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

#3 NP Coordination, incorrect missing junction vowel 'u' following final consonant on bat
amma bati ge3i2i gatta
amma bat-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

In the customization matrix, we added three coordination strategies. Coordination strategy 1 corresponds
to noun coordination and is labelled omnisyndeton, since all coordinands must have the clitic 'i'. We then
chose the affix option with 'i' occurring after the coordinand. Coordination Strategy 2 represents noun and
NP coordiantion as polsyndeton. The word 'saha' appears before every coordinand, except the first. Coordination
strategy 3 was originally an asyndeton pattern for nouns and NPs, but this caused an excessive number of parse
results per test sentence. Instead, we changed Coordination Strategy 3 to reflect VPs and sentences marked with
an asyndeton pattern, which subsequently reduced the number of parses per sentence.

Agreement in NP Coordination:
Sinhala does not have agreement in NP Coordination.

Attributive Adjectives:
Sinhala classifies adjectives into three classes: nominal, verbal, and descriptive.
Descriptive adjectives are the only adjectives considered to be pure adjectives, since nominal
and verbal adjectives have unclear boundaries and can appear identically to nouns and verbs.
Descriptive adjectives occurring attributively precede nouns and they are also divided into subclasses.
These subclasses include: qualitative, demonstrative, and quantitative adjectives. Quantitative
adjectives describe the quantity of a noun or descriptive adjective and include several subtypes:
cardinal numeral, indefinite numeral, and non-numeral adjectives. Cardinal numeral adjectives, except
‘ek2’ (one), follow the noun. ‘ek2’ can only precede a noun. Animacy determines whether a connective is
required with the numeral. Animate nouns required a numeral plus the connective, while inanimate nouns
do not require the connective. (52---not sure if I should keep this or what—there are not any solid
examples.) Indefinite numeral adjectives include: ‘sam2har2’ (some) and ‘okkoma2’ (all). Non-numeral
quantitative adjectives include examples such as 'loku wædi'(too big), which form adjectival phrases.
Sentences with this construction, as well as demonstrative adjectives, are not maximally simple sentences
for the purposes of our project. Adjectives do not agree in case, number, or gender, with the exception of
cardinal numeral adjectives as previously described.

# 1 Qualitative Adjective
loku balla bat kan2wa
loku balla bat ka-n2-wa
big dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The big dog eats rice`

# 4 Cardinal numeral adjective, cardinal 'one' preceding noun
mam2 ek2 pot2 gatta
ma-m2 ek2 pot2 gatta
I-NOM one book.SG buy.PST
`I bought one book`

# 6  Indefinite Adjective
sam2har2 guruw2ru kææwa
sam2har2 guruw2ru kææwa
some teachers.PL eat.PST
`Some teachers eat`

In the customization matrix, attributive adjectives were added with a type names of regular-attr
and cardinal-except-attr. Adjectives in cardinal-except-attr reflect how the adjective modifies items
immediately before the adjective. Attributive adjectives modify items immediately after the adjective.
We labelled these adjectives as attributive only, since we are not adding non-verbal predicates to
our starter grammar this week. These adjectives modify item immediately after the adjective.
Additionally, given we are skipping non-verbal predicates, we chose "impossibly" when asked about
adjective behaving predicatively and appearing as the complement of the copula.


Non-Verbal Predicates:
In Sinhala, predicates are divided into two categories: verbal and non-verbal. In the non-verbal
category, non-verbal clauses are subdivided into equational and non-equational sentences. Equational
sentences include a topic (a nominal) and an adjectival or nominal predicate. The predicate describes
the topic’s quality, category, or characteristics. Non-equational sentences consist of NPs marked with
dative, genitive, ablative, or locative case as predicates. Non-verbal predicates do not require a copula
to combine the subject and the predicate. In adjectival predicates, an assertion mark ‘i’ is required for
vowel final adjectives when they appear as a predicate. This morpheme is not required when consonant-final
adjectives are the predicate or with negative forms.

# 3 Adjectival Predicate, with vowel-final adjective with assertion marker
bat rasai
bat rasa-i
rice delicious-AM
`The rice is delicious`

# 8 Nominal Predicate
eyaa guruw2r2ek
eyaa guruw2r2-ek
She/he teacher-INDF
`She is a teacher`

# 10 Non-Equational
bat mage
bat ma-ge
rice I-GEN
`The rice is mine

This phenomena was not included in the starter grammar this week.


Customization System:

Tense and Aspect:

Sinhala has two tenses: past and non-past. In the matrix, we selected these two common hierarchy element and
added subtypes under past, which included perfect-participle and past-participle. While there are seven aspects
in Sinhala, we are only modeling perfective and completive in our grammar. We opted to create our own hierarchy
of values for aspect and added perfective and completive here. Auxiliaries are also components of aspect, as shown
in these examples:

# 1 Perfective Aspect
dalla bat kalaa tien2wa
dalla bat ka-laa tie-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP be-IND
`The dog has eaten the rice`

# 2 Completive Aspect (perceived completion, like in the future), daa is an aux
dalla bat kalaa daan2wa
dalla bat ka-laa daa-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP daa-IND
`The dog will eat the rice completely`


Word Order:

In the word order section, we added auxiliary verbs. We specified that auxiliaries appear after the complement.
Auxiliary complements are VPs, raising subject and more than one auxiliary can be present in a clause. We did
have the auxiliary sectioned completed for Lab 2, but the auxiliary verb radio button was set to no.

Lexicon:

For auxiliary verbs, three auxiliary features were defined: neg, perf-part-aux, and future-aux. The neg auxiliary
type contributes an independent predicate and takes a noun phrase bearing the case the verbal complement assigns
to its subject as the subject type. We also added a complement feature with a value of finite, nonfinite. Perf-part-
aux is a perfect participle auxiliary that does not contribute a predicate. The subject type is a also a NP bearing
the case the verbal complement assigns to its subject. We added two complement features, one with a value of finite
nonfinite and the second is a tense feature with the value past. Lastly, the future-aux type does not contribute a
predicate and takes the same subject type as the prior auxiliary types. We added two complement features, including
one with finite/nonfinite values and the second as a tense feature with a nonpast value.

Adjectives were described above for the matrix.

For nouns, we largely attempted to use existing items in our lexicon, but we did add a few nouns for some of our
more complicated testsuite examples like coordination. We restructured our noun types based on animacy (animate vs
inanimate), number, and irregularity, which differs from the case-based type system we were using last week. We also
removed indefinite, plural, and case affixes from the nouns since this will now be resolved in morphology. Only the
stem forms of these nouns remain, which is most evident in our pronoun types.

Like with nouns, we attempted to use existing verbs in our lexicon, while only adding a few. We added four new
verb types: involitive, irreg-trans-pst, irreg-trans-pp, and irreg-intrans-pst. Involitive replaces the
transitive-verb-dative-subject type we had in lab 2. Irreg-trans-pst and irreg-intrans-pst house their respective
irregular transitive or intransitive past tense verb respectively. Irreg-trans-pp holds participle verbs with the value
past-part, a component added in syntactic FORM feature for verbs. This FORM feature distinction is new for lab 3.
Lastly, we removed non-past and perfect participle affixes from the verbs since this will now be resolved in morphology.
This leaves only the stem form on these verbs.


Differentiation between lab 2 and lab 3, not previously mentioned:
While some auxiliaries were already included in our testsuite in lab2, we added them to the matrix this week. Auxiliaries
are also a component of Tense/Aspect as previously mentioned. Here is an example from our testsuite.

# 7 AUX following verb
dalla bat kalaa tiyen2wa
dalla bat ka-laa tiyen2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP has
`The dog has eaten the rice`

We removed question verb types from the matrix since this is not yet relevant. We also defined definiteness under "Other
Syntactic and Semantic Features" as a semantic feature for nominal categories, whose values use bool as an existing
value type. Here is an example of definiteness from our testsuite:

# 8 Nominal Predicate
eyaa guruw2r2ek
eyaa guruw2r2-ek
She/he teacher-INDF
`She is a teacher`

We also changed the ash character to 5. We continue to have issues with this character on our personal devices and
within the lkb. Our choices file often adds extra characters and replaces the ash with a different character. These
problems have become more prominent with this lab and we decided it would be best to replace it.

Lastly, we updated the choices file with our new test sentences.


4. Issues:

For adjectives, an example of a sentence that should not have parsed is "mam2 dek2 gas gatta", shown below.

# 9 Cardinal Numeral Adjective, incorrect cardinal order, cardinal number precedes noun
mam2 dek2 gas gatta
ma-m2 dek2 gas gatta
I-NOM two trees.PL buy.PST
`I bought two trees`

Since "dek2" (two) is a cardinal adjective in the cardinal-except-attr type, the adjective must occur after the noun it
modifies. In the lexicon, we specified this adjective modifies items immediately before the adjective in an attempt to
capture this unique property. Due to the combination of Sinhala's free word order and "mam2" being noun, this sentence can parse. The
resulting parse tree shows the adjective modifying mam2 and ignoring "gas" completely. This situation also applies to
our regular-attr type. The sentence, shown below, "balla loku bat kan2wa" should not have parsed because the attributive adjective
follows the noun it modifies.

# 2 Qualitative Adjective, incorrect adjective placement (following noun)
balla loku bat kan2wa
balla loku bat ka-n2-wa
dog.NOM big rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The dog eats big rice`

This sentence has four parse trees, all showing the adjective modifying "bat" (rice). Again, the relatively free word order
of Sinhala combined with the existence of another nearby noun the adjective can modify results in ungrammatical parses.
Additionally, some of the "loku bat" NPs were generated by an adjective head rule followed by the bare NP, while the "balla" NP
was correctly generated by the bare NP but has an additional parse for the nominative lexical rule we created. In evaluating the
results for the grammatical sentence "loku balla bat kan2wa", the parse trees were created via the same rules applying to the
ungrammatical parses. To eliminate the ungrammatical parses and to reduce total number of parses, we think we may need a rule that
prevents cardinal adjectives from modifying the subject when cardinals incorrectly follow the subject. We may need a second rule
targeting attributive adjectives that incorrectly follow the subject but modify the object. Lastly, we may need to modify our
nominative lexical rule so it does not erroneously apply.
