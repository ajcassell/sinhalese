Sinhala/Sinhalese Grammar
January 26, 2024
Melody Bechler, Alexandra Cassell

Our language has several non-ASCII characters. We have assigned numbers to these characters as
follows: ṭ = ʈ = 1, ə = 2, ɖ = 3. In this lab, we are adding ŋ = 4 and æ = 5.

Please note the source, vetted, and phenomena fields have been left out of the provided examples below
for the sole purpose of space. They remain in the testsuite file. Also, the example numbers match those in
the testsuite.

1./2.
Below are descriptions of the phenomena seen in Sinhala. These include sentential negation, agreement,
coordination, agreement in coordinated NPs, attributive predicates, and non-verbal predicates.

Negation in Sinhala can be expressed in two forms. There is a verbal negator (`n55`) and a focus negator
(`newei`). Both immediately follow whatever predicate is to be negated. n55 can only be used for
sentential negation whereas newei can be used for constituent negation as well.
nææ requires the verb it is negating to be marked with the suffix -e, bringing it to the FOCUS aspect
whereas newei occurs at the end of a focused constituent/predicate negating that constituent's/predicate's
focus. In example 9, nææ negates the act of the dog drinking and requires the drink verb
to be in focus. nææ could be replaced by newei in this example and remain grammatical.
However, 4 and 13 show that only newei can be used in nominal predicates.
Lastly, 14 shows that the negator must be directly after the verb for sentential
negation and cannot appear elsewhere in the sentence.

# 9 n55 verbal negator
Judgement: g
balla bonne n55
balla bo-nne n55
dog drink-NPT.FOC no
`The dog does not drink`

# 4 newei focus negator
Judgement: g
eyaa guruw2r2yek newei
eyaa guruw2r2y-ek newei
he teacher-INDF not
`He is not a teacher`

# 13 n55 verbal negator
Judgement: u
eyaa guruw2r2yek n55
eyaa guruw2r2y-ek n55
he teacher-INDF not
`He is not a teacher`

# 14 newei focus negator, wrong position
Judgement: u
eyaa newei guruw2r2yek
eyaa newei guruw2r2y-ek
he not teacher-INDF
`He is not a teacher`

In the customization system, we implemented newei as an independent
adverb that appears after/modifies a VP, and n55 as a negative auxiliary
verb because it appears in the same position as other auxiliary verbs
and has a morphological effect on the verb by requiring it be in
FOCUS with -e suffix.

Sinhala does not show agreement in most item pairs. The verbs do not
show number, person, or gender agreements with the subject except for
the case of second person agreement with imperatives, but that is not
covered here. The subject-verb agreement is only influenced by pragmatics
like imperative phrases and this is not the case in literary Sinhala,
only in colloquial Sinhala which is our focus.

The following information is regarding what we thought was agreement between
verbs and their subjects/objects/agents but upon further explanation,
this is really just a matter of case constraints. Since they were
missed in the previous lab, we include the discussion here.

As mentioned ini the previous lab, Sinhala has a total of six cases:
nominative, accusative, dative, genitive/locative, instrumental,
and vocative. The distribution of these cases on a noun
depends heavily on animacy. In spoken Sinhala, inanimate nouns
can be nominative, genitive, dative, and instrumental. Animate nouns
can be all 6 cases. There is some "agreement" for lack of a better
word between verbs and S/A/O depending on the inherent volitility of a verb.
This is a natural feature of different verbs, not a result of inflection.
Essentially, involitive verbs correspond to involuntary - events without
active agent participation.

V without specification of volitivity means that either can apply.

The following are constraints on S cases depending on the S animacy and the V volitivity:
S.INAM.NOM V
S.ANIM.NOM V.VOL
S.ANIM.ACC V.INVOL
S.ANIM.DAT V.INVOL
(S.ANIM.NOM V.INVOL) - default NOM if ACC marker is dropped.

The following are constraints on A cases depending on the A animacy and the V volitivity:
A.INAM.NOM
A.ANIM.NOM V.VOL
A.ANIM.DAT V.INVOL (generally examples of cognition or sensation)

The following are constraints on O cases depending on the O animacy and definiteness.
The verb's involitivity is irrelevant here:
O.INAM.NOM V
O.ANIM.NOM-INDF V
O.ANIM.ACC-INDF V
O.ANIM.ACC V
O.DAT V - occurs for specific lexically defined verbs

In the testsuite under `### Case Constraints between SOV/AV`,
there are 28 grammatical and ungrammatical examples covering every combination
of animacy, case, and volitivity values. Some obvious examples have
been covered in the Case section of lab 2.
6 and 7 show the two variations of the verb `run` wherein the first
example, the subject I is active in the running, whereas the interpretation
for 7 suggests that the subject I is forced to run because of something.
Both can take an animate subject, but the first is ungrammatical
because the subject is non-nominative.

# 6 SV animate non-nominative subject, volitive verb
Judgement: u
ma12 diuwa
ma12 diuw-a
1SG.DAT run-PST
`I ran`

# 7 SV animate accusative subject, involitive verb
Judgement: g
maaw2 diuna
maaw2 diun-a
1SG.ACC run.INVOL-PST
`I ran` # involuntarily/something made me run

Similarly 14 shows that the inanimate agent for an involitive verb
cannot be dative.

# 14 AV inanimate dative subject, involitive verb
Judgement: u
ka3eet2 5hen2wa
ka3ee-12 5he-n2wa
shop-DAT hear.INVOL-IMPF
`The shop hears`

Finally a grammatical example of an animate nominative and indefinite object is:
# 23 OV animate nominative indefinite object, volitive verb
Judgement: g
balla eluvek kan2wa
balla eluv-ek ka-n2wa
dog.NOM goat.SG.NOM-INDF eat-IND
`The dog eats a goat`

Back to agreement in other forms as requested, Sinhala shows
no agreement between determiners and nouns. So far, we have only
included non-numeral quantifiers as our determiners from lab2 and these
do not have case, person, or gender agreement. Also, by nature these
quantifiers representing `some/several/a few` quantify plural nouns only
so they do not show any inflection between a singular and plural form
depending on the noun.

In the customization system, we therefore did not need to add
any agreement constraints in our lexical rule/types. Instead,
we need to account for the different subject and object cases
allowed for involitive and volitive verbs. Per a Canvas discussion,
this involves us making a specific category of verbs for involitive
with an obligatory position class for the different non-affixing
case subject requirements. We made the involitive class but did not have
time to continue with this update and it is a priority for the upcoming week
to sort out our case analysis/implementation.

Our lexical entries for nouns fall under two noun classes for
animacy and inanimacy.

COORDINATION

Sinhala has multiple ways to express coordination.
First, there is collateral coordination which is essentially
linking together similar clauses that all share a constituent.
For example, the following example shows one subject for
three verb phrases. After testing this, it was left out (for now) from the customization
because it was generating very large numbers of parses (12-200+) because
of the lack of case and agreement constraints on noun - thus every combination
of NP was being coordinated.

# 1 Collateral coordination - phrases with shared missing piece (i.e subject dog)
Judgement: g
balla ged2r2 en2wa bat kan2wa 1iiwee bal2n2wa
balla ged2r2 e-n2wa bat ka-n2wa 1iiwee bal2-n2wa
dog home come-IND rice eat-IND TV watch-IND
`The dog comes home, has a meal and watches TV`

The second type is conjunctive coordination which involves the clitic -i (or sometimes
-t) added as suffixes to the units of coordination. This is used for NPs and NOMs.
For consonant-final nouns, 'u' is added as an epenthetic vowel after the final consonant
but before the clitic. Example 2 shows this clitic
on three NPs whereas example 3 only shows 2, making it ungrammatical because all
units must contain the clitic. This can also be used to coordinate more detailed
NPs such as in #6 where the clitic is on the direct object i.e. "shirt" ("for the dog").

# 2 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: g
guruw2rui demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2 k2laa
guruw2ru-i demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2 k2laa
teachers-CONJ parents-CONJ children-CONJ road clean.PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

# 3 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: u
guruw2ru demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2 k2laa
guruw2ru demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2 k2laa
teachers parents-CONJ children-CONJ road clean.PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

# 6 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: g
amma balla12 kamisekui balla12 gaum2kui ara4 dunna
amma balla-12 kamiseku-i balla-12 gaum2ku-i ara4 dunna
mother dog-DAT shirt.INDF-CONJ dog-DAT gown.INDF-CONJ buy.PP give.PST
`Mother bought a shirt for the dog and a gown for the dog`

An example with the epenthetic vowel is:
Judgement: g
amma batui ge3i2i gatta
amma batu-i ge3i2-i gatta
mother rice-CONJ fruit-CONJ buy.PST
`Mother bought the rice and the fruit`

Sinhala also has a noun-coordinating constituent `saha`. This can only be used
to coordinate nouns, making example # 9 ungrammatical.

# 8 Conjunctive coordination - saha noun-coordinator
Judgement: g
mam2 bat saha amma bat kan2wa
mam2 bat saha amma bat ka-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice.NOM and mother rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice and mother eats rice`

# 9 Conjunctive coordination - saha cannot coordinate clauses
Judgement: u
mam2 bat kan2wa saha amma bat kan2wa
mam2 bat ka-n2wa saha amma bat ka-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice.NOM eat-IND and mother rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice and mother eats rice`

Lastly, we have participle coordination for series of verb events.
In participle coordination, the final event in the series is form PST and
all of the preceding events are past participles, like in #10.
# 12 is ungrammatical because the first event is not a past participle.

# 10 Participle coordination
Judgement: g
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla k55m2 k55wa
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla k55m2 k55wa
1SG.NOM house.ACC go.PP food.ACC eat.PST
`I went home and ate`

# 12 Participle coordination
Judgement: u
balla ged2r2 yan2wa, mam2 k55m2 k55wa
balla ged2r2 ya-n2-wa, mam2 k55m2 k55wa
dog.NOM house.ACC go-NPT-IND, 1SG.NOM food.ACC eat.PST
`The dog went home and I ate`

In the customization matrix, we added three coordination strategies. Coordination strategy 1 corresponds
to noun coordination and is labelled omnisyndeton, since all coordinands must have the clitic 'i'. We then
chose the affix option with 'i' occurring after the coordinand. Coordination Strategy 2 represents noun and
NP coordination as polsyndeton. The word 'saha' appears before every coordinand, except the first. Coordination
strategy 3 was originally an asyndeton pattern for nouns and NPs, but this caused an excessive number of parse
results per test sentence. Instead, we changed Coordination Strategy 3 to reflect VPs and sentences marked with
an asyndeton pattern, which subsequently reduced the number of parses per sentence. Strategy 3
will be updated later in the TDL files to account for this PP verb constraint.

Agreement in NP Coordination:
Sinhala does not have agreement in NP Coordination. There is no requirement for agreement
between constituents of coordination. In terms of what the mother of the coordination rule
has for values in agreement with the daughters, we found no discussion of that. It is our
understanding since Sinhala does not have subject verb agreement, at least,
that there is no requirement for the mother NP to be of a certain PNG since
this does not affect the verb it can pair with.

Attributive Adjectives:
Sinhala classifies adjectives into three classes: nominal, verbal, and descriptive.
Descriptive adjectives are the only adjectives considered to be pure adjectives, since nominal
and verbal adjectives have unclear boundaries and can appear identically to nouns and verbs.
Descriptive adjectives occurring attributively precede nouns and they are also divided into subclasses.
These subclasses include: qualitative, demonstrative, and quantitative adjectives. Quantitative
adjectives describe the quantity of a noun or descriptive adjective and include several subtypes:
cardinal numeral, indefinite numeral, and non-numeral. Cardinal numeral adjectives, except
‘ek2’ (one), follow the noun. ‘ek2’ can only precede a noun. Indefinite numeral adjectives include:
‘sam2har2’ (some) and ‘okkoma2’ (all). Non-numeral quantitative adjectives include examples such as
'loku w5di'(too big), which form adjectival phrases. Sentences with this construction, as well as
demonstrative adjectives, are not maximally simple sentences for the purposes of our project.
Adjectives do not agree in definiteness, number, or gender, with the exception of
cardinal numeral adjectives as previously described. We did not find any examples
where case matches, though it is stated that this is possible.

# 1 Qualitative Adjective
loku balla bat kan2wa
loku balla bat ka-n2-wa
big dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The big dog eats rice`

# 4 Cardinal numeral adjective, cardinal 'one' preceding noun
mam2 ek2 pot2 gatta
ma-m2 ek2 pot2 gatta
1SG-NOM one book.SG buy.PST
`I bought one book`

# 6  Indefinite Adjective
sam2har2 guruw2ru k55wa
sam2har2 guruw2ru k55wa
some teacher.PL eat.PST
`Some teachers eat`

The following examples show that there is no gender inflection on the `tall` adjective.

# 10 animate masculine
Judgement: g
us2 ekaa aawa
us2 ekaa aawa
tall one.ANIM came
`The tall one came`

# 11 animate female
Judgement: g
us2 ekii aawa
us2 ek-ii aawa
tall one-ANIM.FEM came
`The tall one came`

In the customization matrix, attributive adjectives were added with a type names of regular-attr
and cardinal-except-attr. Adjectives in cardinal-except-attr reflect how the adjective modifies items
immediately before the adjective. Attributive adjectives modify items immediately after the adjective.
We labelled these adjectives as attributive only, since we are not adding non-verbal predicates to
our starter grammar this week. These adjectives modify items immediately after the adjective.
Additionally, given we are skipping non-verbal predicates, we chose "impossibly" when asked about
adjective behaving predicatively and appearing as the complement of the copula.

Non-Verbal Predicates:
In Sinhala, predicates are divided into two categories: verbal and non-verbal. In the non-verbal
category, non-verbal clauses are subdivided into equational and non-equational sentences. Equational
sentences include a topic (a nominal) and an adjectival or nominal predicate. The predicate describes
the topic’s quality, category, or characteristics. Non-equational sentences consist of NPs marked with
dative, genitive, ablative, or locative case as predicates. Non-verbal predicates do not require a copula
to combine the subject and the predicate. In adjectival predicates, an assertion mark ‘i’ is required for
vowel final adjectives when they appear as a predicate. This morpheme is not required when consonant-final
adjectives are the predicate or with negative forms.

# 3 Adjectival Predicate, with vowel-final adjective with assertion marker
Judgement: g
bat rasai
bat rasa-i
rice delicious-AM
`The rice is delicious`

# 8 Nominal Predicate
Judgement: g
eyaa guruw2r2ek
eyaa guruw2r2-ek
3SG.NOM teacher-INDF
`She is a teacher`

# 10 Non-Equational
Judgement: g
bat mage
bat ma-ge
rice 1SG-GEN
`The rice is mine

This phenomena was not included in the starter grammar this week.

Lastly, these are some responses to comments from Lab 2 as well as a
discussion of our choices in the lexicon and morphology hierarchies.

In order to account for verb constraints, casing and other affixes,
we updated the lexicon and morphology to allow inflection.
In terms of morphology, we included two verbal position classes.
The first is for npt-ind (not past/indicative) which works on intransive,
transitive, and auxiliary verbs (exception the negation one) by the suffix -n2wa.
This actually needs to be further analyzed because some sources represent -n2 and -wa
as different suffixes. The second is for past-part which adds the suffix -laa to
any non-aux verb. For nouns, we have three position classes: indefiniteness which comes
initially, case. Indefiniteness only works on common nouns
(inanimate or animate) appending -ek or -ak, and for case there are rules for dative, accusative, genitive,
nominative, and nominative-pronoun nouns. The case position class takes
the indefiniteness-pc as input to follow the correct order of affixing.
The nominative rule is a zero rule which has no affix but turns the base form
into nominative casing. The nominative-pronoun rule was created because
it was the only example we saw where nominative was marked with an affix.
We had a plural rule that applied to only 2sg and 3sg because common nouns and 1sg
do not show the same pattern, but we opted to have a fully formed lexicon instead
so made individual types for these two personal pronouns.

We also defined definiteness under "Other Syntactic and Semantic Features"
as a semantic feature for nominal categories, whose values use bool as an existing
value type. We have the indefinitness-pc to mark common nouns that are indefinite
as seen in # 23. In Lab 2 these were a separate noun class.
# 23 OV animate nominative indefinite object, volitive verb
Judgement: g
balla eluvek kan2wa
balla eluv-ek ka-n2wa
dog.NOM goat.SG.NOM-INDF eat-IND
`The dog eats a goat`

We restructured our noun types based on animacy (animate vs inanimate), number,
and irregularity, which differs from the case-based type system we were using last week.
We also removed indefinite, plural, and case affixes from the nouns since this will
now be resolved in morphology. Only the stem forms of these nouns remain,
which is most evident in our pronoun types.

We have three irregular verb types that are in our testsuite but
do not seemingly follow one of our morphological patterns.
There is irreg-trans-pst, irreg-trans-pp, and irreg-intrans-pst. The same
goes for our two irregular noun classes irreg-plural, irreg-indef, and
irreg-acc. These are in forms that are close to but do not perfectly
match with our other verbs and nouns that are inflected so for the time
being they exist in their own category so that they do not undergo the same
inflections. Involitive replaces the transitive-verb-dative-subject
verb type we had in lab 2 and at the moment, just contains verbs that have this
feature, though this has not been implemented in the customization system.

For auxiliary verbs, three auxiliary features were defined: neg, past-part-aux, and future-aux. The neg auxiliary
type contributes an independent predicate and takes a noun phrase bearing the case the verbal complement assigns
to its subject. We also added the complement features of finite, nonpast, focus. Past-part-aux
is a past participle auxiliary that does not contribute a predicate. The subject type is a also a NP bearing
the case the verbal complement assigns. We added two complement features, one with a value of finite
nonfinite and the second is a tense feature with the value past. Lastly, the future-aux type does not contribute a
predicate and takes the same subject type as the prior auxiliary types (though we found it weird that it
specifies past tense on the verb when it indicates the future). We added two complement features, including
one with finite/nonfinite values and the second as a tense feature with a nonpast value.

In the word order section, we added auxiliary verbs. We specified that auxiliaries appear after the complement.
Auxiliary complements are VPs, raising subject and more than one auxiliary can be present in a clause. We did
have the auxiliary sectioned completed for Lab 2, but the auxiliary verb radio button was set to no.

Differentiation between lab 2 and lab 3, not previously mentioned:
Auxiliaries were added to the matrix and we updated the incorrect
gloss for tien2wa (used to be `has` which came from our source)

# 7 AUX following verb
dalla bat kalaa tien2wa
dalla bat ka-laa tie-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP be-IND
`The dog has eaten the rice`

We updated the grammar's tense system as well.
Sinhala has two tenses: past and non-past. In the matrix, we selected these two common hierarchy element and
added the past-participle subtype. The past-participle is a subtype of nonfinite
though this will require more analysis as this prevented any S with a past participle
VP to fail to parse because the form was not finite, but it was our understanding that
it should be nonfinite. We changed to finite and were able to parse more of the sentences.

While there are seven aspects in Sinhala, we are only modeling perfective and completive in our grammar.
We opted to create our own hierarchy of values for aspect and added perfective and completive here.
Auxiliaries are also components of aspect, as shown in these examples:

# 1 Perfective Aspect
dalla bat kalaa tien2wa
dalla bat ka-laa tie-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP be-IND
`The dog has eaten the rice`

# 2 Completive Aspect (perceived completion, like in the future), daa is an aux
dalla bat kalaa daan2wa
dalla bat ka-laa daa-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP daa-IND
`The dog will eat the rice completely`

3. The properties of our language/testsuite not yet implemented have been sprinkled
throughout this discussion, but these mainly include the FOCUS feature, IND mood,
adjectival predicate rule "-AM", and participle coordination.

4. First, please note that the sentences in our testsuite that we are not
expecting to parse because they haven't been added to the grammar matrix are
the wh-questions, non-verbal predicates, and participle coordination.
We have a total of 126 sentences, for which 33 are correctly parsed
giving us 39.8% coverage. Our grammar continues to generate multiple
parses per sentence. In many cases, this is due to the ambiguity of
subject and object casing as well as the optionality of the nominative-lex-rule
on those subjects and objects. This leaves us with similar trees that have
N-N branches where the rule applies and N when it doesn't.

We also have significant improvement from Lab2. All of our basic word order
examples parse correctly, as well as our sentences with nominative pronouns that
undergo inflection like:
# 2 1sg personal pronoun
Judgement: g
mam2 bat kan2wa
ma-m2 bat ka-n2wa
1SG-NOM rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice`

We were able to see correct inflection of pronouns into the dative case as well
(though not a complete parse) but could not see this for the 1SG-ACC in # 8. This is
because this is irregular and undergoes a somewhat different change than the
other pronouns in that an additional a is added between the stem (ma) and the suffix (w2).
# 8 Accusative case pronoun
Judgement: g
maaw2 bat kan2wa
ma-aw2 bat ka-n2wa
1SG-ACC rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice`

Our test sentences showing our past-part auxiliary and our
future auxiliary also both parse, as well as correctly ruling ungrammatical
the sentence # 8 where the auxiliary is in the wrong order.
# 7 AUX following verb
Judgement: g
balla bat kalaa tien2wa
balla bat ka-laa tie-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP be-IND
`The dog has eaten the rice`

# 8 AUX preceding verb
Judgement: u
balla bat tien2wa kalaa
balla bat tie-n2wa ka-laa
dog.NOM rice.NOM be-IND eat-PP
`The dog has eaten the rice`

In terms of coordination, looking at parse charts show that
the conjuctive coordination using the clitic -i seems to work, as
a mother constituent joins the three NPs that we have in example
# 2 and fail to do so when one is missing the clitic like in # 3.
However, the parse chart shows 4 different possible S but generates no parses,
despite what we believe the Subj-Head rule would do bringing together
the coordinated NP subjects with the VP. (This issue was resolved due to a
FORM mismatch).
# 2 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: g
guruw2rui demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2k2laa
guruw2ru-i demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2k2-laa
teacher.PL-CONJ parent.PL-CONJ child.PL-CONJ road clean-PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

# 3 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: u
guruw2ru demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2k2laa
guruw2ru demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2k2-laa
teacher.PL parent.PL-CONJ child.PL-CONJ road clean-PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

Participle coordination sentences do not parse yet, given that
our implementation cannot yet be done in the matrix (mentioned in #5 below).

We have a couple of sentences that are non-verbal predicates (but translate like
idioms) but show genitive/locative casing and these are not expected to work yet.
#7 Genitive/Locative
Judgement: g
war2d2 mage atee
war2d2 ma-ge at-ee
fault.NOM 1SG-GEN hand-LOC
`The fault lies with me`

Something else we didn't incorporate yet properly in the matrix
is the concept of Focus which is a feature of verbs and can be changed
with negation and wh-questions. We will need to work on this for next week.

So far, negation seems to be parsing correctly and rejecting incorrect order of the
negation aux n55 seen below. However, the independent adverb newei is
not recognizable in the lexicon and that is an issue we are looking into.
# 15 n55 verbal negator with transitive verb, no dative
Judgement: g
balla bat kan2wa n55
balla bat ka-n2wa n55
dog.NOM rice eat-IND no
`The dog does not eat the rice`

# 16 n55 verbal negator, preceding verb
Judgement: u
balla bat n55 kan2wa
balla bat n55 ka-n2wa
dog.NOM rice no eat-IND
`The dog does not eat the rice`

Our biggest problem remains with case. We have implemented Sinhala as a split-S
system and are able to accurately parse for nominative-accusative subject-object sentences.
However, there are instances where the object can be another case, mentioned
in 1./2. above. These sentences are failing because the object case is incorrect.

Also, a lot of our test sentences that show dative and ablative casing are
not necessarily on the verb's object, but what appears more like a prepositional
phrase such as "to the shop" below.
# 8
Judgement: g
mam2 ka3ee12 yan2wa
ma-m2 ka3ee-12 ya-n2-wa
1SG-NOM shop-DAT go-NPT-IND
`I go to the shop`
Removing the ka3ee-12 parses correctly since `ya` is an intransitive verb stem
and doesn't require an object. Therefore, we need to figure out what
implementation we are lacking for what seem like PPs. We tried unification
with ka3ee12 and yan2wa but this failed on the COMP-HEAD rule because
ka3ee12 is not an object of the verb.

An example of a sentence that parsed but shouldn't (we think)
is # 4. The quantifier sam2harak is to be used with only plural nouns
and here we use the singular pot2. It is possible we need some kind of
head-specifier number agreement constraint. However, you'll see that
sam2har2 is also under the adjectives in our lexicon as an indefinite
adjective but doesn't specify number either so we are wondering
whether it is possible that this adjective could modify a singular noun,
although it would need to undergo indefinite-pc to become sam2harak
and that is not applicable to adjectives at the moment.
# 4 Quantifier "some"
Judgement: u
mam2 pot2 sam2harak gatta
ma-m2 pot2 sam2harak gatta
1SG-NOM book.SG some.PL buy.PST
`I bought some book`

Another sentence that should not have parsed was
# 9 Cardinal Numeral Adjective, incorrect cardinal order, cardinal number precedes noun
mam2 dek2 gas gatta
ma-m2 dek2 gas gatta
1SG-NOM two tree.PL buy.PST
`I bought two trees`

Since "dek2" (two) is a cardinal adjective in the cardinal-except-attr type, the adjective must occur after the noun it
modifies. In the lexicon, we specified this adjective modifies items immediately before the adjective in an attempt to
capture this unique property. Due to the combination of Sinhala's free word order and "mam2" being noun, this sentence can parse. The
resulting parse tree shows the adjective modifying mam2 and ignoring "gas" completely. This situation also applies to
our regular-attr type. The sentence, shown below, "balla loku bat kan2wa" should not have parsed because the attributive adjective
follows the noun it modifies.

# 2 Qualitative Adjective, incorrect adjective placement (following noun)
balla loku bat kan2wa
balla loku bat ka-n2-wa
dog.NOM big rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The dog eats big rice`

This sentence has four parse trees, all showing the adjective modifying "bat" (rice). Again, the relatively free word order
of Sinhala combined with the existence of another nearby noun the adjective can modify results in ungrammatical parses.
Additionally, some of the "loku bat" NPs were generated by an adjective head rule followed by the bare NP, while the "balla" NP
was correctly generated by the bare NP but has an additional parse for the nominative lexical rule we created. In evaluating the
results for the grammatical sentence "loku balla bat kan2wa", the parse trees were created via the same rules applying to the
ungrammatical parses. To eliminate the ungrammatical parses and to reduce total number of parses, we think we may need a rule that
prevents cardinal adjectives from modifying the subject when cardinals incorrectly follow the subject. We may need a second rule
targeting attributive adjectives that incorrectly follow the subject but modify the object. Lastly, we may need to modify our
nominative lexical rule so it does not erroneously apply.

5. There are a few areas where the customization is not
fully equipped to work on Sinhala. Firstly, the language
shows coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination above. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic. Second, we were unable to get the `saha` nominal coordination word
to show up in the lexicon despite being included in the matrix. Instead
it showed up as saha2.

Extra Questions:
1. Should we deal with words that behave differently whether they end
with a vowel or not, thus requiring an extra letter before an affix?
For example guruw2r2 requires a following y before a suffix because
it ends in a vowel, so it does not behave the same as consonant ending nouns.
