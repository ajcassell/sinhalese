Our language has several non-ASCII characters. We have assigned numbers to these characters as
follows: ṭ = ʈ = 1, ə = 2, ɖ = 3. In this lab, we are adding ŋ = 4 and æ = 5.

Below are descriptions of the phenomena seen in Sinhala. These include sentential negation, agreement,
coordination, agreement in coordinated NPs, attributive predicates, and non-verbal predicates.

Negation in Sinhala can be expressed in two forms. There is a verbal negator (`nææ`) and a focus negator
(`newei`). Both immediately follow whatever predicate is to be negated. nææ can only be used for
sentential negation whereas newei can be used for constituent negation as well.
nææ requires the verb it is negating to be marked with the suffix -e, bringing it to the FOCUS aspect
whereas newei occurs at the end of a focused constituent/predicate negating that constituent's/predicate's
focus. In example 9, nææ negates the act of the dog drinking and requires the drink verb
to be in focus. nææ could be replaced by newei in this example and remain grammatical.
However, 4 and 13 show that only newei can be used in nominal predicates.
Lastly, 14 shows that the negator must be directly after the verb for sentential
negation and cannot appear elsewhere in the sentence.

# 9 nææ verbal negator
Judgement: g
balla bonne nææ
balla bo-nne nææ
dog drink-NPT.FOC no
`The dog does not drink`

# 4 newei focus negator
Judgement: g
eyaa guruw2r2yek newei
eyaa guruw2r2y-ek newei
he teacher-INDF not
`He is not a teacher`

# 13 nææ verbal negator
Judgement: u
eyaa guruw2r2yek nææ
eyaa guruw2r2y-ek nææ
he teacher-INDF not
`He is not a teacher`

# 14 newei focus negator, wrong position
Judgement: u
eyaa newei guruw2r2yek
eyaa newei guruw2r2y-ek
he not teacher-INDF
`He is not a teacher`

In the customization system, we implemented newei as an independent
adverb that appears after/modifies a VP, and nææ as a negative auxiliary
verb because it appears in the same position as other auxiliary verbs
and has a morphological effect on the verb by requiring it be in
FOCUS with -e suffix.

Sinhala does not show agreement in most item pairs. The verbs do not
show number, person, or gender agreements with the subject except for
the case of second person agreement with imperatives, but that is not
covered here. The subject-verb agreement is only influenced by pragmatics
like imperative phrases and this is not the case in literary Sinhala,
only in colloquial Sinhala which is our focus.

The following information is regarding what we thought was agreement between
verbs and their subjects/objects/agents but upon further explanation,
this is really just a matter of case constraints. Since they were
missed in the previous lab, we include the discussion here.

As mentioned ini the previous lab, Sinhala has a total of six cases:
nominative, accusative, dative, genitive/locative, instrumental,
and vocative. The distribution of these cases on a noun
depends heavily on animacy. In spoken Sinhala, inanimate nouns
can be nominative, genitive, dative, and instrumental. Animate nouns
can be all 6 cases. There is some "agreement" for lack of a better
word between verbs and S/A/O depending on the inherent volitility of a verb.
This is a natural feature of different verbs, not a result of inflection.
Essentially, involitive verbs correspond to involuntary - events without
active agent participation.

V without specification of volitivity means that either can apply.

The following are constraints on S cases depending on the S animacy and the V volitivity:
S.INAM.NOM V
S.ANIM.NOM V.VOL
S.ANIM.ACC V.INVOL
S.ANIM.DAT V.INVOL
(S.ANIM.NOM V.INVOL) - default NOM if ACC marker is dropped.

The following are constraints on A cases depending on the A animacy and the V volitivity:
A.INAM.NOM
A.ANIM.NOM V.VOL
A.ANIM.DAT V.INVOL (generally examples of cognition or sensation)

The following are constraints on O cases depending on the O animacy and definiteness.
The verb's involitivity is irrelevant here:
O.INAM.NOM V
O.ANIM.NOM-INDF V
O.ANIM.ACC-INDF V
O.ANIM.ACC V
O.DAT V - occurs for specific lexically defined verbs

In the testsuite under `### Case Constraints between SOV/AV`,
there are 28 grammatical and ungrammatical examples covering every combination
of animacy, case, and volitivity values. Some obvious examples have
been covered in the Case section of lab 2.
6 and 7 show the two variations of the verb `run` wherein the first
example, the subject I is active in the running, whereas the interpretation
for 7 suggests that the subject I is forced to run because of something.
Both can take an animate subject, but the first is ungrammatical
because the subject is non-nominative.

# 6 SV animate non-nominative subject, volitive verb
Judgement: u
ma12 diuwa
ma12 diuw-a
1SG.DAT run-PST
`I ran`

# 7 SV animate accusative subject, involitive verb
Judgement: g
maaw2 diuna
maaw2 diun-a
1SG.ACC run.INVOL-PST
`I ran` # involuntarily/something made me run

Similarly 14 shows that the inanimate agent for an involitive verb
cannot be dative.

# 14 AV inanimate dative subject, involitive verb
Judgement: u
ka3eet2 æhen2wa
ka3ee-12 æhe-n2wa
shop-DAT hear.INVOL-IMPF
`The shop hears`

Finally a grammatical example of an animate nominative and indefinite object is:
# 23 OV animate nominative indefinite object, volitive verb
Judgement: g
balla eluvek kan2wa
balla eluv-ek ka-n2wa
dog.NOM goat.SG.NOM-INDF eat-IND
`The dog eats a goat`

Back to agreement in other forms as requested, Sinhala shows
no agreement between determiners and nouns. So far, we have only
included non-numeral quantifiers as our determiners from lab2 and these
do not have case, person, or gender agreement. Also, by nature these
quantifiers representing `some/several/a few` quantify plural nouns only
so they do not show any inflection between a singular and plural form
depending on the noun.

With respect to adjectives, they can show agreement in case with their
associated NP. Otherwise, they do not inflect for number, gender, or
definiteness. The gender distinction of feminine and masculine (not animacy)
only affects singular suffixes on nouns.

The following examples show that there is no gender inflection on the `tall` adjective.

# 10 animate masculine
Judgement: g
us2 ekaa aawa
us2 ekaa aawa
tall one.ANIM came
`The tall one came`

# 11 animate female
Judgement: g
us2 ekii aawa
us2 ek-ii aawa
tall one-ANIM.FEM came
`The tall one came`

In the customization system, we therefore did not need to add
any agreement constraints in our lexical rule/types. Instead,
we added the many case constraints outlined into the ....

Our lexical entries for nouns fall under two noun classes for
animacy and inanimacy.


-----
COORDINATION

Sinhala has multiple ways to express coordination.
First, there is collateral coordination which is essentially
linking together similar clauses that all share a constituent.
For example, the following example shows one subject for
three verb phrases.

# 1 Collateral coordination - phrases with shared missing piece (i.e subject dog)
Judgement: g
balla ged2r2 en2wa bat kan2wa 1iiwee bal2n2wa
balla ged2r2 e-n2wa bat ka-n2wa 1iiwee bal2-n2wa
dog home come-IND rice eat-IND TV watch-IND
`The dog comes home, has a meal and watches TV`

The second type is conjunctive coordination which involves the clitic -i (or sometimes
-t) added as suffixes to the units of coordination. Example 2 shows this clitic
on three NPs whereas example 3 only shows 2, making it ungrammatical because all
units must contain the clitic. This can also be used to coordinate more detailed
NPs such as in #6 where the clitic is on the direct object i.e. "shirt" ("for the dog").

# 2 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: g
guruw2rui demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2 k2laa
guruw2ru-i demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2 k2laa
teachers-CONJ parents-CONJ children-CONJ road clean.PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

# 3 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: u
guruw2ru demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2 k2laa
guruw2ru demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2 k2laa
teachers parents-CONJ children-CONJ road clean.PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

# 6 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: g
amma balla12 kamisekui balla12 gaum2kui ara4 dunna
amma balla-12 kamiseku-i balla-12 gaum2ku-i ara4 dunna
mother dog-DAT shirt.INDF-CONJ dog-DAT gown.INDF-CONJ buy.PP give.PST
`Mother bought a shirt for the dog and a gown for the dog`

Sinhala also has a noun-coordinating constituent `saha`. This can only be used
to coordinate nouns, making example #9 ungrammatical.

# 8 Conjunctive coordination - saha noun-coordinator
Judgement: g
mam2 bat saha amma bat kan2wa
mam2 bat saha amma bat ka-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice.NOM and mother rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice and mother eats rice`

# 9 Conjunctive coordination - saha cannot coordinate clauses
Judgement: u
mam2 bat kan2wa saha amma bat kan2wa
mam2 bat ka-n2wa saha amma bat ka-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice.NOM eat-IND and mother rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice and mother eats rice`

Lastly, we have participle coordination for series of verb events.
In participle coordination, the final event in the series is form PST and
all of the preceding events are past participles, like in #10.
#12 is ungrammatical because the first event is not a past participle.

# 10 Participle coordination
Judgement: g
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla kææm2 kææwa
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla kææm2 kææwa
1SG.NOM house.ACC go.PST.PTCP food.ACC eat.PST
`I went home and ate`

# 12 Participle coordination
Judgement: u
balla ged2r2 yan2wa, mam2 kææm2 kææwa
balla ged2r2 ya-n2-wa, mam2 kææm2 kææwa
dog.NOM house.ACC go-NPT-IND, 1SG.NOM food.ACC eat.PST
`The dog went home and I ate`

Lastly, these are some notes in response to comments from Lab 2






PARSING


plural pronoun rule -- I had to change pl-pronoun-lex-rule := plural-pc-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.NUM singular ]. to be singular... in sinhalese.tdl..

mam2 ka3eet2 yan2wa fails on comp-head rule because to the shop is dat and not an object of verb

think because we have nom-acc set up, it's failing when objects are not accusative

Are we handling PPs yet for "for me" dative?

What kind of constituents are ablative and dative complements? NPs? from this shop, to the shop?

balla yan2wa n55 - works without the "to the shop" dative case because it's an intransitive verb
--> (15+16) same, like this works!: balla bat kan2wa n55 (transitive with acc noun)
reversing the order of n55 fails.. because has to follow the verb.. though it does appear to do subj-head with bat?

bug maybe?? the newei negation adverb shows in choices, but nowhere in lexicon...
saha also doesn't show up...



Got mam2 ek2 pot2 gatta working, but not pot2 ek2 as it should not be

A lot of multiple parses because N-N for optional nominative-lex-rule

The fault lies with me examples are kinda like idioms and are non-verbal which are test-suite only examples for this lab

Something that parses but shouldnt: mam2 pot2 sam2harak gatta (singular noun)
-- needs some kind of head specifier num agreement?



4. First, please note we commented out the non-verbal predicate and
wh-questions that are not covered in the customized grammar yet so as
to have a clearer picture of how our grammar performs against the features
we have tried implementing. That makes ____ sentences, for which ___ are covered
giving us ____% coverage.

We also have significant improvement from Lab2. All of our basic word order
examples parse correctly, as well as our sentences with nominative pronouns that
undergo inflection like:
# 2 1sg personal pronoun
Judgement: g
mam2 bat kan2wa
ma-m2 bat ka-n2wa
1SG-NOM rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice`

We were able to see correct inflection of pronouns into the dative case as well
(though not a complete parse) but could not see this for the 1SG-ACC in # 8. This is
because this is irregular and undergoes a somewhat different change than the
other pronouns in that an additional a is added between the stem (ma) and the suffix (w2).
# 8 Accusative case pronoun
Judgement: g
maaw2 bat kan2wa
ma-aw2 bat ka-n2wa
1SG-ACC rice.NOM eat-IND
`I eat rice`

Our test sentences showing our past-part auxiliiary and our
future auxiliary also both parse, as well as correctly ruling ungrammatical
the sentence # 8 where the auxiliary is in the wrong order.
# 7 AUX following verb
Judgement: g
balla bat kalaa tien2wa
balla bat ka-laa tie-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP be-IND
`The dog has eaten the rice`

# 8 AUX preceding verb
Judgement: u
balla bat tien2wa kalaa
balla bat tie-n2wa ka-laa
dog.NOM rice.NOM be-IND eat-PP
`The dog has eaten the rice`

In terms of coordination, looking at parse charts show that
the conjuctive coordination using the clitic -i seems to work, as
a mother constituent joins the three NPs that we have in example
# 2 and fail to do so when one is missing the clitic like in # 3.
However, the parse chart shows 4 different possible S but generates no parses,
despite what we believe the Subj-Head rule would do bringing together
the coordinated NP subjects with the VP.
# 2 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: g
guruw2rui demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2k2laa
guruw2ru-i demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2k2-laa
teacher.PL-CONJ parent.PL-CONJ child.PL-CONJ road clean-PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

# 3 Conjunctive coordination - clitic -i affixed to units of coordination
Judgement: u
guruw2ru demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 sudd2k2laa
guruw2ru demaupiyo-i lam2inu-i paar2 sudd2k2-laa
teacher.PL parent.PL-CONJ child.PL-CONJ road clean-PST
`The teachers, parents and children cleaned the road`

Participle coordination sentences do not parse yet, given that
our implementation cannot yet be done in the matrix (mentioned in #5 below).

Something else we didn't incorporate yet properly in the matrix
is the concept of Focus which is a feature of verbs and can be changed
with negation and wh-questions. We will need to work on this for next week.

Our biggest problem remains with case.

An example of a sentence that parsed but shouldn't (we think)
is # 4. The quantifier sam2harak is to be used with only plural nouns
and here we use the singular pot2. It is possible we need some kind of
head-specifier number agreement constraint. However, you'll see that
sam2har2 is also under the adjectives in our lexicon as an indefinite
adjective but doesn't specify number either so we are wondering
whether it is possible that this adjective could modify a singular noun,
although it would need to undergo indefinite-pc to become sam2harak
and that is not applicable to adjectives at the moment.
# 4 Quantifier "some"
Judgement: u
mam2 pot2 sam2harak gatta
ma-m2 pot2 sam2harak gatta
1SG-NOM book.SG some.PL buy.PST
`I bought some book`


5. There are a few areas where the customization is not
fully equipped to work on Sinhala. Firstly, the language
shows coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination above. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic.
