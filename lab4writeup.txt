Possessives:
In Sinhala, a possessive relationship among animate nouns is represented by the genitive marker
-ge/-gee. If an inanimate noun takes the possessor role, then a locative suffix '-ee' is used.
Possession is marked on the possessor with the suffix and the order is possessor-first. It appears
the possessors are specifier-like because they take the place of the determiner. These phrases follow
the canonical word order of SOV.

# 1 Inanimate Locative Possession
mam2 potee pitu bal2n2wa                                 # NOTE: this is not parsing, example only
ma-m2 pot-ee pitu bal2-n2wap
1SG-NOM book-LOC pages read-NPT
`I read the pages of the book`

#9 Pronominal Possession
mage balla bat kan2wa
ma-ge ball-a bat ka-n2-wa
I.SG-GEN dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND
`My dog eats rice`

# 7 Animate Genitive Possession
eyaa lam2yage pot2 bal2n2wa
eyaa lam2in-a-ge pot-2 bal2-n2-wa
3SG.NOM child-SG-GEN book-SG.ACC read-NPT-IND
`He read the child's book`

In the adnominal possession section, we chose possessor-first for word order, given the information
provided in our references. Possessors seem to take the place of the determiner. As previously mentioned,
the possessor appears as an affix on the possessor, but we noted in the matrix that the affix does not
agree in gender with the possessum. As shown in grammatical number #7 above, the possessum "pot" is
inanimate gender while "lam2in" is animate gender, therefore these genders do not agree. In the morphology
section, we added a possession position class that obligatorily occurs with three lexical rule types. We
added animate possession to capture '-ge' and '-gee' possessive suffixes and inanimate possession to capture
'-ee' suffixes. Lastly, we added a nonpossessive lexical rule for nouns in which possession does not apply.

A note about #1 not parsing: In a previous version of our choices file, #1 parsed but now shows 'mam2', 'potee',
and 'bal2n2wa' do not form nouns or verbs. We think this may have to do with the order of our rules, but are unsure.
Additionally, both the locative and genitive suffixes are parsing for examples #7 and #9 above when they should note
be. We believe this is due in part to the possessive position class holding genitive case while the case position
class also has genitive case. Our ungrammatical examples, one is shown below, undergo the non-possessive lexical rule
only to pick up their respective cases in the case position class, instead of going through the possessive animate or
possessive inanimate rule. We also noticed that this occurs with our grammatical examples. We believe the solution to
this issue requires us to remove the possessive position class and instead utilize the existing case position class.
In the adnomial possession section of the matrix, we plan to create a new possessive strategy without the morpheme.
Animate and Inanimate is crucial to possession, so we are still figuring out how to incorporate animacy into our
existing case position class for this purpose.

Declarative Clausal Complements:
Verbs of sign, knowledge, report, speech, discovery, or forensic acts take complement clauses with
a subordinating conjunction. These subordinating conjunctions are added to the end of an embedded
clause and include: 'baw2', 'wag2', and 'wittia'. When the verb denotes thinking, expecting, imagining,
fearing, or any sense of uncertainty, the subordinating conjuction 'ki2la' is used. These are
obligatory conjunctions. No special morphology is required on the verb. The embedded clause appears
before the matrix verb and they are not nominalized. The word order between the matrix and embedded
clauses is not different as free word order remains in embedded clauses.

# 1 Declarative Clausal Complement, baw2 subordinating conjunction, complement precedes main
Judgement: g
balla bat kan2wa baw2 eyaa dann2wa
ball-a bat ka-n2-n2 baw2 eyaa dan-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND that.QM 3.SG know-NPT-IND                   # NOTE: does not parse
`She knows that the dog eats rice`

# 4 Declarative Clausal Complement with ki2la formal noun
Judgement: g
balla bat k55wa ki2la eyaa hit2-n2wa                                    # NOTE: does not parse
ball-a bat ka-u-wa ki2la eyaa hit2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-PST-IND QM 3.SG think-NPT-IND
`She thinks that the dog ate rice`

In the clausal complement section, we have one clausal complement type. We noted that object complement clauses
are placed in the same position as regular noun complements and our strategy is for embedding. We added two
complementizer spellings, which include "baw2" and "ki2la". We also made sure the word order page listed subordinate
clause order as the same as the matrix clause.

Our ungrammatical variations of the above sentences parse. These variations do not have the subordinating conjunction,
which is required for grammaticality. In #1 and #4 above, 'balla', 'kauwa', and 'hit2n2wa' do not even form stems when
looking at the parse chart. In other sentences and the ungrammatical ones below, stems for these words are formed and 
the affixes are properly added. This is peculiar, since it seems the subordinating conjunction is interfering with the
lexicon and then the morphological rules here.
The ungrammatical ones that parse include:

# 3 Declarative Clausal Complement, missing formal noun associated with clausal complement

Yes/No Questions:
Yes/no questions are formed by using the 'd2' particle following the predicate. Questions in which
any constituent other than the verb is chosen for questioning, the 'd2' particle follows questioning
constituent and the verb is marked with a focus form. Multiple word orders are possible with this
focus form. If the focus constituent is moved, the question particle 'd2' must move with the it. In
declarative yes/no questions, the question particle appears between the sentence boundary and the final
verb. Without the question particle, questions in declarative form would simply be declarative
sentences. For negative yes/no questions, the question particle is added to the negative particle. In the
case of "n55", "n55" and "d2" are combined to create the negative question particle "n5dd2". For the
negative particle "newei", the question particle is simply added after the negative particle.

# 1 Yes/no - neutral forms /SOV
eyaa kalisa4 andin2wa d2
eyaa kalisa4 andi-n2wa d2
3.SG slacks wear-NPT Q
`Does she wear slacks?`

# 3 Yes/No - focus question / OVS
kalisa4 andinne eyaa d2
kalisa4 andi-nne eyaa d2
slacks wear-NPT.FOC she Q
`Is it she that wears slacks?`

# 13 Negative Yes/No question, combined particle
eyaa bat kannne n5dd2
eyaa bat kan-nn-e n5dd2
3.SG rice eat-NPT-FOC no.Q
`Doesn't he eat rice?`

In the matrix yes/no section, we stated that question particles occur clause finally. We added two particles:
'd2' and 'n5dd2'. For 'd2', we stated the particle is obligatory and occurs in both main and embedded clauses.
For 'n5dd2', we stated the particle is obligatory but only occurs in main clauses. Sinhala does not have
subject-verb inversion nor does it have verbal inflection for these purposes, therefore these options were
left unchecked.


Customization Matrix Only:
With nominalization, the highest argument of the verb must have genitive case once the verb is nominalized and the
highest argument can never be the patient argument of a transitive verb. The highest argument cannot have nominative
case when the verb is nominalized as nominalized verbs do not assign nominative case in Sinhala. Genitive marking on
the object not acceptable. Nominalization applies to verbal predicates only. According to our sources, nominalization
is restricted to verbs only and is a inflectional morphology process. This means the verb is suffixed with 'ek2' or
'iim2' and the nominalized verb does not have a tense affix.

Since this is matrix only, we only added to the nominalized clause section of the matrix. We added a Nominalization
strategy where the nominalization of the clause occurs on the verb. We also stated that it should be reflected in the
semantics because genitive case under nominalization is considered to have the highest semantic role.

Note: this was matrix only this week. There are no examples in the testsuite.
