TO DO:

** Figure out tense (and form) system in general! Source literally says non-past and past.
- future-aux goes with our Completive Aspect
- Emily says past participles are FINITE.. and they represent FORM (the one used to make past tenses)

- FOCUS
  - -nne for present, -e for past
  - When focus form is on verb, it means another constituent (not the verb) is focused
  - newei is a focus particle -> immediately follows the verb of a neutral sentence (meaning verb is not
  focus marked) or the focus of a focused sentence (tells what to negate or what to stress)
- CASE (see below)


Morphology:
- update n2 to be suffix for NPT (and rules)
- update wa to be suffix for IND mood (and rules)

- update u to be suffix for PST
- update la to be suffix for PP

- restrict nominative-pronoun rule to pronouns only. "You could have it require the pronoun noun class as input, for example, or create a separate position class for it to reside in that takes pronouns as input (only)."
- Make [ DEF + ] rule (with no affix) in the same position class, and you'll want the position class to be obligatory.
- make nominative noun rule obligatory
- change collateral coordination strategy to VPs, not NPs

- Something that says that adjectives can't modify pronouns, actually. I'm not sure we can do this via the customization system, but in tdl editing you can add a feature [ PRON bool ] (which you might get from the adnominal possessives library anyway) and have the adjectives require their MOD to be [ PRON - ] while the pronouns say that they are [ PRON + ].
- Make the plural determiners only apply to plural nouns

- Adjective issue with ras2 vs rasa-i with nonverbal predicates

Lexicon:
- change sam2har2 and okkoma2 to be determiners instead of adjectives
- Constraining sam2har2 to plural only -- that is certainly doable. If you keep sam2harak as an adjective, it can constrain its MOD to be [ NUM pl ]. If you make it a determiner, then it can constrain its SPEC to be [ NUM pl ].
- Make different verb classes with different case frames (with case frames being sensitive to noun class)

Features:
- Make -i an actual clitic and deal with epenthetic vowel




Optional:
- commented out saha as clause coordinator possibility.. go back if time
- commented out two newei examples for non-verbal predicates
- you probably want to use the agreement mechanism to handle the matching of case across coordinated NPs. This brings up a really interesting question vis a vis the vol/invol verbs: What happens if you coordinate animate and inanimate subjects with a VOL intransitive verb? What case does each one take?
---------------------------------------

****** (S.ANIM.NOM V.INVOL) - default NOM if ACC marker is dropped ????????????

O.DAT V - occurs for specific lexically defined verbs *****

CASE:

volitive verbs:
s:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NPM
o:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NOM INDEF or ACC INDEF or ACC DEF
a:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NOM

involitive verbs:
s:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> ACC or DAT (choosing to not put NOM* here)
o:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NOM INDEF or ACC INDEF or ACC DEF
a:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> DAT

---------------------------------------
Questions:
- for our irregular verbs like gihilla .. both of our sources show this as go.PP without any inflection. How
are we supposed to assume a morphophonological analyzer on this if our sources don't show us any patterns or
segmentation? Should we use different verbs?
    - do we just put gihil in as the root, even though that might not be accurate but we aren't using it elsewhere?

- The future-aux type does not contribute a predicate and takes the same subject type as the prior auxiliary types (though we found it weird that it
specifies past tense on the verb when it indicates the future).
EMB> Can you give me some IGT? What makes you say that it specifies past tense on the verb?

- How do we know if nominal case is obligatory? A lot of our sources' IGT examples do not case mark a nominative subject, but
then do show the NOM gloss in other areas and the spelling is the same, so we were under the assumption that they were
just not being included. For that reason, we didn't make the nominative-case-rule obligatory but you are suggesting otherwise
because it is giving us a lot of ambiguity.

What to write up (on top of everything that changes from above.. add here incrementally):
- Descriptive adjectives precede the noun
- Discuss what it means without INDF marking
