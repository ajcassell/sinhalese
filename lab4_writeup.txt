Our language has several non-ASCII characters. We have assigned numbers to these characters as
follows: ṭ = ʈ = 1, ə = 2, ɖ = 3, ŋ = 4 and æ = 5.

Please note the source, vetted, and phenomena fields have been left out of the provided examples below
for the sole purpose of space. They remain in the testsuite file. Also, the example numbers match those in
the testsuite.

We made a lot of changes to our grammar this week in areas that we didn't
get to or were challenged with last week. Those that are more important
will be discussed first, then followed by this week's new features, as
these improvements were necessary to (try to) get the new features working.

We totally revamped the morphology and lexicon once we learned how
to analyze the morphology better. We created 5 verb types - vol-trans,
vol-intrans, invol-trans, invol-intrans, and dec-clausal. The new feature
below was defined called INVOL to be on the different verb classes and this
was needed because our morphological rules apply different depending on
volitivity.

feature2_name=INVOL
feature2_type=index
feature2_cat=verb
feature2_new=no
feature2_existing=bool

We updated our morphological rules to have 7 verb position classes.
The first obligatory on a verb is the one applying case constraints
to the subject and objects of verbs. We have vol-case-constraints-pc (#9),
invol-case-constraints-pc (#7), invol-trans-case-constraints-pc, and
invol-intrans-case-constraints-pc. The last two are separate because the
subject behaves differently depending on transitivity whereas VOL verbs
have the same allowed subject cases regardless of transitivity. INVOL
object casing is handled in invol-case-constraints, which takes the other
two more specific classes as its possible inputs - that way the trans pc
only applies to trans verbs and the intrans pc only applies to
intrans verbs but the invol-case-constraints applies to both.

** DISCUSS CASE CONSTRAINTS **

Next comes the obligatory tense-pc which contains lexical rules for
npt (non-past - suffix n2), pp (past-participle - suffix la),
pst-invol, and pst-vol which are two past tense rules that have different suffixes
(a and u respectively). This takes the pc #7 and #9 as inputs.

Then comes the while-modifier-pc which is used for one of our
adverbial clausal modifier strategies that appends the suffix
-ham2, updates the form to be WHILE and tense to be past as
described below:

verb-pc13_inputs=verb-pc12
 verb-pc13_lrt1_name=while
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_name=form
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_value=while
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_name=tense
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_value=past
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_head=verb
   verb-pc13_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
   verb-pc13_lrt1_lri1_orth=ham2

Our final pc is the mood-pc. This is not an obligatory
class because some verbs are in adjectival form ADJ and do
not take a mood. We have an IND rule and a FOC rule - FOC
is technically not a mood but because these two have the same
position and possible inputs, they were grouped together.

verb-pc4_inputs=verb-pc13
  verb-pc4_lrt1_name=ind
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_name=mood
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_value=indicative
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_orth=wa
  verb-pc4_lrt2_name=foc
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_name=information-structure meaning
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_value=focus
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc4_lrt2_lri1_orth=e

FOCUS was added on the Information Structure page as a postverbal
affix marker and this was defined as -e in the rule above.

Our noun lexicon and morphology were also updated extensively as
we settled on a standard segmentation of nouns depending on
gender, animacy, and number. The following shows noun endings for
these combinations:

            Singular    Plural
Masc        a/aa        o, u, laa
Fem         2           o, u, laa
Inanimate   2, ee       wal, n, 0

Thus we inventoried our nouns and updated/segmented them so
that each took the proper ending based on its noun class,
and updated the testsuite with proper segmentation and glossing.

For noun morphology, our source states that definiteness, if applicable,
comes before case. It does not specify where the number position class
should occur but we made the decision to make number the first, though
there are almost no examples in the text that combines all three classes,
since most examples are with DEF nouns which have no affix.

The number-pc applies to all nouns and is obligatory.

Our indefiniteness-pc takes number-pc as input and
now has a zero-rule for DEF. When nominals appear unmarked, they
assume definiteness:

noun-pc1_lrt2_name=definite-rule
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_name=DEF
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_value=+
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_head=itself
  noun-pc1_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=no

Our case-pc rules remain the same, but now take indefiniteness-pc
and mood-pc (used for clausal complements) as input in addition to all
singular pronoun types. It is also obligatory so that if no other case, a noun
is marked nominative.

*** also number-pc???

Now moving on to this week's features...

Adverbial Clausal Modifiers:

In Sinhala, subordination occurs through verbal endings, inflectional forms
with subordination particles, and case markers (likely nominalization).

The first that we implemented is the affix -ddi. It attaches directly to the verb
root to indicate unspecified time i.e. the English "while".

** ADD EXAMPLE ** / matrix

Another verb ending is -ham2 which requires that the subordinate verb be PST tense.

** ADD EXAMPLE ** / Matrix

All examples show that the subordinate clause precedes the main clause.

Clauses of cause and reason (because/since) are mainly formed with case markers
or inflection plus a particle. Two examples of particles are hinda and nissa which behave
identically. These particles occur with PST or NPT adjectival forms of the subordinate
verb in cases of dynamic verbs, not stative verbs (i.e. not "is").

** ADD EXAMPLE ** / matrix

We did not get around to implementing the case markers. They seem characteristic
of nominalization. The options are the dative -12 or the instrumental/ablative
-in suffix which are affixed to the PST or NPT form of subordinate verb.
Here are both examples in our testsuite. We have added nominalization in
the customization system but it is not working yet...

# 6 Subordination via dative verb casing + non-past subordinate verb
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2wa12 mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2-wa-12 ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT-IND-DAT 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

# 8 Subordination with instrumental verb casing + past subordinate verb
Judgement: g
oyaa pot2 bal2wain mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa pot-2 bal2-u-wa-in ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM book-SG read-PST-IND-INS 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you read the book`

** explain in system **
(example of nominalization in my notes - pay for cleaning)

Finally, there is another strategy which is simply the past participle
construction which shows sequential relation of cause and effect.
This was not included as a strategy in the customization system though.











5. There are a few areas where the customization is not
fully equipped to work on Sinhala. Firstly, the language
shows coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination above. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic. Second, we were unable to get the `saha` nominal coordination word
to show up in the lexicon despite being included in the matrix. Instead
it showed up as saha2.
