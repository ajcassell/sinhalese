Our language has several non-ASCII characters. We have assigned numbers to these characters as
follows: ṭ = ʈ = 1, ə = 2, ɖ = 3, ŋ = 4 and æ = 5.

Please note the source, vetted, and phenomena fields have been left out of the provided examples below
for the sole purpose of space. They remain in the testsuite file. Also, the example numbers match those in
the testsuite.

1./2.

We made a lot of changes to our grammar this week in areas that we didn't
get to or were challenged with last week. Those that are more important
will be discussed first, then followed by this week's new features, as
these improvements were necessary to (try to) get the new features working.

We totally revamped the morphology and lexicon once we learned how
to analyze the morphology better. We created 5 verb types - vol-trans,
vol-intrans, invol-trans, invol-intrans, and dec-clausal. The new feature
below was defined called INVOL to be on the different verb classes and this
was needed because our morphological rules apply different depending on
volitivity.

feature2_name=INVOL
feature2_type=index
feature2_cat=verb
feature2_new=no
feature2_existing=bool

We updated our morphological rules to have 7 verb position classes.
The first obligatory on a verb is the one applying case constraints
to the subject and objects of verbs. We have vol-case-constraints-pc (#9),
invol-case-constraints-pc (#7), invol-trans-case-constraints-pc, and
invol-intrans-case-constraints-pc. The last two are separate because the
subject behaves differently depending on transitivity whereas VOL verbs
have the same allowed subject cases regardless of transitivity. INVOL
object casing is handled in invol-case-constraints, which takes the other
two more specific classes as its possible inputs - that way the trans pc
only applies to trans verbs and the intrans pc only applies to
intrans verbs but the invol-case-constraints applies to both.

** DISCUSS CASE CONSTRAINTS **

Next comes the obligatory tense-pc which contains lexical rules for
npt (non-past - suffix n2), pp (past-participle - suffix la),
pst-invol, and pst-vol which are two past tense rules that have different suffixes
(a and u respectively). This takes the pc #7 and #9 as inputs.

Then comes the while-modifier-pc which is used for one of our
adverbial clausal modifier strategies that appends the suffix
-ham2, updates the form to be WHILE and tense to be past as
described below:

verb-pc13_inputs=verb-pc12
 verb-pc13_lrt1_name=while
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_name=form
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_value=while
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_name=tense
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_value=past
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_head=verb
   verb-pc13_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
   verb-pc13_lrt1_lri1_orth=ham2

Our final pc is the mood-pc. This is not an obligatory
class because some verbs are in adjectival form ADJ and do
not take a mood. We have an IND rule and a FOC rule - FOC
is technically not a mood but because these two have the same
position and possible inputs, they were grouped together.

verb-pc4_inputs=verb-pc13
  verb-pc4_lrt1_name=ind
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_name=mood
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_value=indicative
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_orth=wa
  verb-pc4_lrt2_name=foc
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_name=information-structure meaning
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_value=focus
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc4_lrt2_lri1_orth=e

FOCUS was added on the Information Structure page as a postverbal
affix marker and this was defined as -e in the rule above.

Our noun lexicon and morphology were also updated extensively as
we settled on a standard segmentation of nouns depending on
gender, animacy, and number. The following shows noun endings for
these combinations:

            Singular    Plural
Masc        a/aa        o, u, laa
Fem         2           o, u, laa
Inanimate   2, ee       wal, n, 0

Thus we inventoried our nouns and updated/segmented them so
that each took the proper ending based on its noun class,
and updated the testsuite with proper segmentation and glossing.

For noun morphology, our source states that definiteness, if applicable,
comes before case. It does not specify where the number position class
should occur but we made the decision to make number the first, though
there are almost no examples in the text that combines all three classes,
since most examples are with DEF nouns which have no affix.

The number-pc applies to all nouns and is obligatory.

Our indefiniteness-pc takes number-pc as input and
now has a zero-rule for DEF. When nominals appear unmarked, they
assume definiteness:

noun-pc1_lrt2_name=definite-rule
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_name=DEF
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_value=+
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_head=itself
  noun-pc1_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=no

Our case-pc rules remain the same, but now take indefiniteness-pc
and mood-pc (used for clausal complements) as input in addition to all
singular pronoun types. It is also obligatory so that if no other case, a noun
is marked nominative.

*** also number-pc???


Upon feedback, we also updated our coordination strategy that uses -i
to be a separate clitic so our glosses were updated for this to be a separate
whitespace separated morpheme.

*** add example? *** if it works LOL

Now moving on to this week's features...

Embedded Complement Clauses - Declarative:

Sinhala's strategy for embedded declaratives is solely to use obligatory
"formal nouns" like witti2, wag2, and baw2. The complement object is
embedded between the subject and the predicate of the main clause. If the subject
is identical between the two clauses, then it can be deleted from ....

Since there is free word order, the embedded clauses are also free to
appear after or in the middle of the main clause. However, most often
the pattern is that complement causes precede the main clause. The free word
order remains for the embedded clause as well. There isn't specification
that embedded clauses are necessarily nominalized. In fact, I think I only saw
one example of this.

**** has that been implemented? *****

There is no special morphology on the verb.


^^^^ whoops this is not my section....

Embedded Complement Clauses - Interrogative:
The same analysis for the embedded declarative clauses holds
true with interrogatives. The only apparent difference is that to indicate
the interrogative, Sinhala uses the Question (Q) and Quotative (QM)
markers the same way they appear in questions. The sources
only give one example and don't discuss embedded interrogatives
further so the assumption is that this is as intricate as they get.
For example:

# 11 Embedded Interrogative, complement precedes main
Judgement: g
bat kan2wa d2 ki2la mam2 ballagen 5huwa
bat ka-n2-wa d2 ki2la ma-m2 ball-a-gen 5h-u-wa
rice eat-NPT-IND Q QM 1SG-NOM dog-SG-ABL ask-PST-IND
`I asked the dog whether he eats rice`

The ungrammatical examples have Q, QM, or both missing such as:

# 9 Embedded Interrogative, missing QM
Vetted: f
Judgement: u
mam2 ballagen 5huwa bat kan2wa d2
ma-m2 ball-a-gen 5h-u-wa bat ka-n2-wa d2
1SG-NOM dog-SG-ABL ask-PST-IND rice eat-NPT-IND Q
`I asked the dog whether he eats rice`

This was not an implementation requirement in the customization system this week
so we have just included testsuite examples. It seems relatively trivial though
since the pattern of embedded interrogatives seems the same as standalone
interrogatives, but we didn't get to trying this in the grammar yet.

Adverbial Clausal Modifiers:

In Sinhala, subordination occurs through verbal endings, inflectional forms
with subordination particles, and case markers (likely nominalization).

The first that we implemented is the affix -ddi. It attaches directly to the verb
root to indicate unspecified time i.e. the English "while".

** ADD EXAMPLE ** / matrix

Another verb ending is -ham2 which requires that the subordinate verb be PST tense.

** ADD EXAMPLE ** / Matrix

All examples show that the subordinate clause precedes the main clause.

These verb markers were implemented in the customization system as
.......

Clauses of cause and reason (because/since) are mainly formed with case markers
or inflection plus a particle. Two examples of particles are hinda and nissa which behave
identically. These particles occur with PST or NPT adjectival forms of the subordinate
verb in cases of dynamic verbs, not stative verbs (i.e. not "is").

** ADD EXAMPLE ** / matrix

These were implemented as free subordinator morphemes that appear after the S
they attach to, as heads, and require a specific form on their verb complement.
.....

We did not get around to implementing the case markers. They seem characteristic
of nominalization. The options are the dative -12 or the instrumental/ablative
-in suffix which are affixed to the PST or NPT form of subordinate verb.
Here are both examples in our testsuite. We have added nominalization in
the customization system but it is not working yet...

# 6 Subordination via dative verb casing + non-past subordinate verb
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2wa12 mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2-wa-12 ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT-IND-DAT 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

# 8 Subordination with instrumental verb casing + past subordinate verb
Judgement: g
oyaa pot2 bal2wain mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa pot-2 bal2-u-wa-in ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM book-SG read-PST-IND-INS 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you read the book`

** explain in system **
(example of nominalization in my notes - pay for cleaning)

Finally, there is another strategy which is simply the past participle
construction which shows sequential relation of cause and effect.
This was not included as a strategy in the customization system though.

An example of this is (Do not parse):

Ranjit kakul2 k2pila ispiritaale-12 ara4 giya
Ranjit leg cut.INVL.PP hospital-DAT carry.PAST
`Ranjit was taken to hospital because he had cut his leg/foot (involuntarily)`

*** ^ maybe that should be.... (I mean it should parse as is, probably by asyndetonic coordination)

There are other types of complemental clauses as well that are not included in our
grammar that correspond to conditional (if), concession (although), purpose (to),
and more.






Argument Optionality:
Sinhala is referred to as a "super pro-drop" language by two of our sources.
However, neither goes into extensive detail and perhaps that is because the language
is so free. The first source discusses it with regards to ellipsis where NPs including
the subject and object are often omitted and the most freely deleted subjects are
first and second pronouns, usually because they are contextual in a spoken/written conversation.

These examples show no subject, no object, and both missing respectively.

# 3 No subject
Judgement: g
bat gatta
bat gan-u-wa
rice buy-PST-IND
`(I) bought rice`

# 4 No object
Judgement: g
eyaa gatta
eyaa gan-u-wa
3SG.NOM buy-PST-IND
`She bought (it)`

# 2 No subject or object declarative
Judgement: g
gatta
gan-u-wa
buy-PST-IND
`I bought it`

This allows for a lot of ambiguity because when parsing, since it is possible
to posit any pronoun as the subject given that Sinhala doesn't have
any subject verb agreement. The subject of example #3 could be I, we, you, she,
they... The second source refers to pro-drop as null
anaphora and declares that arguments can be freely omitted in all argument
positions except for complements of postpositional phrases. This exception
has not been included in the grammar this week. This extensive pro-drop
is more prevalent in spoken Sinhala and more often than not, allowed.

Another scenario is where Sinhala allows the deletion of non-nominative elements
if they are obvious in context. This is the case with "experiencer" subjects that
are in the dative case. The following examples show how the Assertion Marker (AM)
works with adjectives to form a sentence with no subject (as well as no verb).

# 7 Assertion marker with non-assumed subject
Judgement: g
siit2lai
sitt2la-i
cold-AM
`It's cold / I feel cold` # Cold

Similarly, weather predicates do not require a subject.

# 8 No Subject, intransitive verb
Judgement: g
wahin2wa
wahi-n2-wa
rain-NPT-IND
`It's raining`

Interestingly, Sinhala also allows verb dropping with the existential or
possessive verbs inn2wa and tiyen2wa. This was not included in the grammar
because it is not the same as argument optionality but it is included here
just for curiosity.

n55, taatta ged2r2 n55
no, father home no
`No, father isn't home`

In the customization system, pro-drop was implemented for subjects and objects
with any verb, and no subject markers permitted when dropped or not. There are
no markers on the verbs in any pro-drop instances. The assertion marker
does not represent any information for the missing argument. It is a separate
feature. There was no evidence of contexts in which pro-drop was forbidden
except for the complements of postpositions as mentioned above, but the sources
did not provide any examples of this. We may be able to refine later if more
information is found, but for now, the argument optionality is extremely free
in our colloquial Sinhala grammar. Also for this reason, we did not need to
include OPT or other ARG features in the lexicon and morphology as mentioned
on the customization system.

section=arg-opt
subj-drop=subj-drop-all
subj-mark-drop=subj-mark-drop-not
subj-mark-no-drop=subj-mark-no-drop-not
subj-con=subj-con-always
obj-drop=obj-drop-all
obj-mark-drop=obj-mark-drop-not
obj-mark-no-drop=obj-mark-no-drop-not

Because of this freedom in colloquial Sinhala, we were unable to think of
any ungrammatical examples for the testsuite.








Things that we did not get around to:
1. Incorporating agreement in case for coordinated NPs depending on
INVOL of verbs to answer the question of what happens if you coordinate
ANIM and INANIM subjects with a VOL intransitive verb, or if the case constraints
would restrict this.
2.

5. There are a few areas where the customization is not
fully equipped to work on Sinhala. Firstly (and this is
carry over from last week's lab but keeping here as a reminder),
the language shows coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic. We also will need something that says that adjectives
cannot modify pronouns which will need to be done in TDL editing with a
[ PRON bool ] feature and have the adjectives require their MOD to be
[ PRON - ] while the pronouns say that they are [ PRON + ].


Extra Questions:
1. What does "complements of postpositional phrases" mean?
