Our language has several non-ASCII characters. We have assigned numbers to these characters as
follows: ṭ = ʈ = 1, ə = 2, ɖ = 3, ŋ = 4 and æ = 5.

Please note the source, vetted, and phenomena fields have been left out of the provided examples below
for the sole purpose of space. They remain in the testsuite file. Also, the example numbers match those in
the testsuite.

We made a lot of changes to our grammar this week in areas that we didn't
get to or were challenged with last week. Those that are more important
will be discussed first, then followed by this week's new features, as
these improvements were necessary to (try to) get the new features working.

We totally revamped the morphology and lexicon once we learned how
to analyze the morphology better. We created 5 verb types - vol-trans,
vol-intrans, invol-trans, invol-intrans, and dec-clausal. The new feature
below was defined called INVOL to be on the different verb classes and this
was needed because our morphological rules apply different depending on
volitivity.

feature2_name=INVOL
feature2_type=index
feature2_cat=verb
feature2_new=no
feature2_existing=bool

We updated our morphological rules to have 7 verb position classes.
The first obligatory on a verb is the one applying case constraints
to the subject and objects of verbs. We have vol-case-constraints-pc (#9),
invol-case-constraints-pc (#7), invol-trans-case-constraints-pc, and
invol-intrans-case-constraints-pc. The last two are separate because the
subject behaves differently depending on transitivity whereas VOL verbs
have the same allowed subject cases regardless of transitivity. INVOL
object casing is handled in invol-case-constraints, which takes the other
two more specific invol classes as its possible inputs - that way the trans pc
only applies to trans verbs and the intrans pc only applies to
intrans verbs but the invol-case-constraints applies to both.

This is the list of case constraints (not consolidated for ease of reading).
A lexical rule type was made for each line and in the cases of animate objects
one was made for anim + NOM INDEF and one for anim + ACC (INDEF unspecified)

volitive verbs:
s:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NPM
o:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NOM INDEF or ACC INDEF or ACC DEF
a:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NOM

involitive verbs:
s:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> ACC or DAT (choosing to not put NOM* here)
o:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> NOM INDEF or ACC INDEF or ACC DEF
a:  inam -> NOM
    anim -> DAT

An example of a constraint working is as follows.

# 27 OV animate accusative indefinite object, volitive verb
Judgement: g
balla sadd2yak kan2wa
ball-a sadd-2-ak ka-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG noise.ACC-SG-INDF eat-NPT-IND
`The dog eats a noise`

In the parse chart, the noun dog undergoes the four position
classes for a noun: number, poss, def, and case resulting in a Bare NP.
The object noise undergoes the same but with indefiniteness, and the volitive verb
first undergoes VOL-SUBJ-LEX (nominative noun), then VOL-INANIM-OBJ-LEX
(inanimate nominative), tense and mood position classes.

A negative scenario is the following and it does not parse because
the volitive verb cannot take an animate dative subject.

# 17 AV animate dative subject, volitive verb
Judgement: u
ma12 kan2wa
ma-12 ka-n2-wa
1SG-DAT eat-NPT-IND
`I eat`

Next comes the obligatory tense-pc which contains lexical rules for
npt (non-past - suffix n2), pp (past-participle - suffix la),
pst-invol, and pst-vol which are two past tense rules that have different suffixes
(a and u respectively). This takes the pc #7 and #9 as inputs.

Then comes the optional while-modifier-pc which is used for one of our
adverbial clausal modifier strategies that appends the suffix
-ham2, updates the form to be WHILE and tense to be past as
described below:

verb-pc13_inputs=verb-pc12
 verb-pc13_lrt1_name=while
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_name=form
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_value=while
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_name=tense
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_value=past
   verb-pc13_lrt1_feat2_head=verb
   verb-pc13_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
   verb-pc13_lrt1_lri1_orth=ham2

Our final pc is the mood-pc. This is not an obligatory
class because some verbs are in adjectival form ADJ and do
not take a mood. We have an IND rule and a FOC rule - FOC
is technically not a mood but because these two have the same
position and possible inputs, they were grouped together.
We are considering making ADJ a mood type with no affix and
changing this mood-pc to be obligatory.

verb-pc4_inputs=verb-pc13
  verb-pc4_lrt1_name=ind
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_name=mood
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_value=indicative
    verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_orth=wa
  verb-pc4_lrt2_name=foc
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_name=information-structure meaning
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_value=focus
    verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc4_lrt2_lri1_orth=e

FOCUS was added on the Information Structure page as a postverbal
affix marker and this was defined as -e in the rule above.

Our noun lexicon and morphology were also updated extensively as
we settled on a standard segmentation of nouns depending on
gender, animacy, and number. The following shows noun endings for
these combinations:

            Singular    Plural
Masc        a/aa        o, u, laa
Fem         2           o, u, laa
Inanimate   2, ee       wal, n, 0

Thus we inventoried our nouns and updated/segmented them so
that each took the proper ending based on its noun class,
and updated the testsuite with proper segmentation and glossing.

For noun morphology, our source states that definiteness, if applicable,
comes before case. It does not specify where the number position class
should occur but we made the decision to make number the first, though
there are almost no examples in the text that combines all three classes,
since most examples are with DEF nouns which have no affix. We have an
outstanding question about the rule order because for example #27 above,
the definiteness rule does not occur where it is supposed to.

The number-pc applies to all nouns and is obligatory.

Our indefiniteness-pc takes number-pc as input and
now has a zero-rule for DEF. When nominals appear unmarked, they
assume definiteness:

noun-pc1_lrt2_name=definite-rule
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_name=DEF
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_value=+
  noun-pc1_lrt2_feat1_head=itself
  noun-pc1_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=no

Our case-pc rules remain the same, but now takes indefiniteness-pc
and mood-pc (used for nominalization in clausal complements) as input in addition to all
singular pronoun types. It is also obligatory so that if no other case, a noun
is marked nominative.

Upon feedback, we also updated our coordination strategy that uses -i
to be a separate clitic so our glosses were updated for this to be a separate
whitespace separated morpheme.

Despite no evidence now we DID at least have the NP coordinands working
and just not the verb. However, now when we run the following example,
we are unable to debug the no parses because the parse chat hits an error of
"Hit limit of 200 edges built during unpacking".

Now moving on to this week's features...

Possessives:
In Sinhala, a possessive relationship among animate nouns is represented by the genitive marker
-ge/-gee. If an inanimate noun takes the possessor role, then a locative suffix '-ee' is used.
Possession is marked on the possessor with the suffix and the order is possessor-first. It appears
the possessors are specifier-like because they take the place of the determiner. These phrases follow
the canonical word order of SOV.

# NOTE: this is not parsing, example only - see note below
# 1 Inanimate Locative Possession
mam2 potee pitu bal2n2wa
ma-m2 pot-ee pitu bal2-n2wap
1SG-NOM book-LOC page.PL read-NPT
`I read the pages of the book`

#9 Pronominal Possession
mage balla bat kan2wa
ma-ge ball-a bat ka-n2-wa
I.SG-GEN dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND
`My dog eats rice`

# 7 Animate Genitive Possession
eyaa lam2yage pot2 bal2n2wa
eyaa lam2in-a-ge pot-2 bal2-n2-wa
3SG.NOM child-SG-GEN book.ACC-SG read-NPT-IND
`He read the child's book`

In the adnominal possession section, we chose possessor-first for word order, given the information
provided in our references. Possessors seem to take the place of the determiner. As previously mentioned,
the possessor appears as an affix on the possessor, but we noted in the matrix that the affix does not
agree in gender with the possessum. As shown in grammatical number #7 above, the possessum "pot" is
inanimate gender while "lam2in" is animate gender, therefore these genders do not agree. In the morphology
section, we added a possession position class that obligatorily occurs with three lexical rule types. We
added animate possession to capture '-ge' and '-gee' possessive suffixes and inanimate possession to capture
'-ee' suffixes. Lastly, we added a nonpossessive lexical rule for nouns in which possession does not apply.

section=adnom-poss
  poss-strat1_order=head-final
  poss-strat1_mod-spec=spec
  poss-strat1_mark-loc=possessor
  poss-strat1_possessor-type=affix
  poss-strat1_possessor-affix-agr=non-agree

A note about #1 not parsing: In a previous version of our choices file, #1 parsed but now shows 'mam2', 'potee',
and 'bal2n2wa' do not form nouns or verbs. We think this may have to do with the order of our rules, but are unsure.
Additionally, both the locative and genitive suffixes are parsing for examples #7 and #9 above when they should not
be. We believe this is due in part to the possessive position class holding genitive case while the case position
class also has genitive case. Our ungrammatical examples, one is shown below, undergo the non-possessive lexical rule
only to pick up their respective cases in the case position class, instead of going through the possessive animate or
possessive inanimate rule. We also noticed that this occurs with our grammatical examples. We believe the solution to
this issue requires us to remove the possessive position class and instead utilize the existing case position class.
In the adnominal possession section of the matrix, we plan to create a new possessive strategy without the morpheme.
Animate and Inanimate is crucial to possession, so these will have to be constraints on the lexical rule types.

# NOTE: parses but is ungrammatical
# 10 Pronominal Possession, incorrect case on possessor

1SG-LOC dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND

Embedded Complement Clauses - Declarative:

Verbs of sign, knowledge, report, speech, discovery, or forensic acts take complement clauses with
a subordinating conjunction. These subordinating conjunctions are added to the end of an embedded
clause and include: 'baw2', 'wag2', and 'witti2'. When the verb denotes thinking, expecting, imagining,
fearing, or any sense of uncertainty, the subordinating conjuction 'ki2la' is used. These are
obligatory conjunctions known as "formal nouns". No special morphology is required on the verb.
The embedded clause appears before the matrix verb. The word order between the matrix and embedded
clauses is not different as free word order remains in embedded clauses.
Since there is free word order, the embedded clauses are also free to
appear after or in the middle of the main clause. However, most often
the pattern is that complement causes precede the main clause. There isn't specification
that embedded clauses are necessarily nominalized. In fact, I think I only saw
one example of this. There is no special morphology on the verb.

# NOTE: does not parse
# 1 Declarative Clausal Complement, baw2 subordinating conjunction, complement precedes main
Judgement: g
balla bat kan2wa baw2 eyaa dann2wa
ball-a bat ka-n2-wa baw2 eyaa dan-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND that.QM 3.SG know-NPT-IND
`She knows that the dog eats rice`

# NOTE: does not parse
# 4 Declarative Clausal Complement with ki2la formal noun
Judgement: g
balla bat k55wa ki2la eyaa hit2-n2wa
ball-a bat ka-u-wa ki2la eyaa hit2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-PST-IND QM 3.SG think-NPT-IND
`She thinks that the dog ate rice`

In the customization system, we have one clausal complement type. We noted that object complement clauses
are placed in the same position as regular noun complements and our strategy is for embedding declaratives. We added two
complementizer spellings, which include "baw2" and "ki2la". We also made sure the word order page listed subordinate
clause order as the same as the matrix clause.

#1 and #4 are able to unify "balla bat kan2wa baw2" to a CP but then the CP and the other S
are not unified and we need to look into this further.
Our ungrammatical variations (below) of the above sentences parse. These variations do not have the subordinating conjunction,
which is required for grammaticality. The reason for this is likely asyndetonic coordination of VP/Ss which
is described in a later section about parse coverage.

# NOTE: parses but is ungrammatical

ball-a ka-u-wa eyaa hit2-n2-wa

Embedded Complement Clauses - Interrogative:
The same analysis for the embedded declarative clauses holds
true with interrogatives. The only apparent difference is that to indicate
the interrogative, Sinhala uses the Question (Q) and Quotative (QM)
markers the same way they appear in questions. The sources
only give one example and don't discuss embedded interrogatives
further so the assumption is that this is as intricate as they get.

This was not an implementation requirement in the customization system this week
so we have just included testsuite examples. It seems relatively trivial though
since the pattern of embedded interrogatives seems the same as standalone
interrogatives, but we didn't get to trying this in the grammar yet.

One thing to note is there is no indication for why the dog is in ablative case
and if the dog is considered the object of ask-PST-IND, then this would not
satisfy any of the case constraint position classes as ablative is not
allowed as an object case.
For example:

# 11 Embedded Interrogative, complement precedes main
Judgement: g
bat kan2wa d2 ki2la mam2 ballagen 5huwa
bat ka-n2-wa d2 ki2la ma-m2 ball-a-gen 5h-u-wa
rice eat-NPT-IND Q QM 1SG-NOM dog-SG-ABL ask-PST-IND
`I asked the dog whether he eats rice`

The ungrammatical examples have Q, QM, or both missing such as:

# 9 Embedded Interrogative, missing QM
Vetted: f
Judgement: u
mam2 ballagen 5huwa bat kan2wa d2
ma-m2 ball-a-gen 5h-u-wa bat ka-n2-wa d2
1SG-NOM dog-SG-ABL ask-PST-IND rice eat-NPT-IND Q
`I asked the dog whether he eats rice`

Yes/No Questions:

Yes/no questions are formed by using the 'd2' particle following the predicate. Questions in which
any constituent other than the verb is chosen for questioning, the 'd2' particle follows questioning
constituent and the verb is marked with a focus form. Multiple word orders are possible with this
focus form. If the focus constituent is moved, the question particle 'd2' must move with the it. In
declarative yes/no questions, the question particle appears between the sentence boundary and the final
verb. Without the question particle, questions in declarative form would simply be declarative
sentences. For negative yes/no questions, the question particle is added to the negative particle. In the
case of "n55", "n55" and "d2" are combined to create the negative question particle "n5dd2". For the
negative particle "newei", the question particle is simply added after the negative particle.

# 1 Yes/no - neutral forms /SOV
eyaa kalisa4 andin2wa d2
eyaa kalisa4 andi-n2-wa d2
3.SG slack.PL wear-NPT-IND Q
`Does she wear slacks?`

# 3 Yes/No - focus question / OVS
kalisa4 andinne eyaa d2
kalisa4 andi-nn-e eyaa d2
slacks wear-NPT-FOC she Q
`Is it she that wears slacks?`

# 13 Negative Yes/No question, combined particle
eyaa bat kannne n5dd2
eyaa bat kan-nn-e n5dd2
3.SG rice eat-NPT-FOC no.Q
`Doesn't he eat rice?`

In the matrix yes/no section, we stated that question particles occur clause-finally. We added two particles:
'd2' and 'n5dd2'. For 'd2', we stated the particle is obligatory and occurs in both main and embedded clauses.
For 'n5dd2', we stated the particle is obligatory but only occurs in main clauses. Sinhala does not have
subject-verb inversion nor does it have verbal inflection for these purposes, therefore these options were
left unchecked.


Adverbial Clausal Modifiers:

In Sinhala, subordination occurs through verbal endings, inflectional forms
with subordination particles, and case markers (likely nominalization).

The first that we tried to implement is the affix -ddi. It attaches directly to the verb
root to indicate unspecified time i.e. the English "while".

** The following TWO do not parse. Hypothesis to follow.

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {Tense Aspect Mood, Clausal modifiers}
balla kaddi mam2 pot2 bal2n2wa
ball-a ka-ddi ma-m2 pot-2 bal2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG eat-while 1SG-NOM book-SG read-NPT-IND
`While the dog is eating, I read the book`

In the customization system, this was implemented as a clausal modifier strategy
that looks like:
section=clausalmods
  cms1_position=before
  cms1_modifier-attach=vp
  cms1_subordinator=none
  cms1_pred=_while_subord_rel
    cms1_feat1_name=form
    cms1_feat1_value=while

Then we added while as a nonfinite FORM type and in our morphology, we added
the while-modifier-pc which affixes these bound subordinator morphemes.
The second requires nonpast tense on the subordinate verb whereas the first,
with the suffix -ham2 requires past tense. This morpheme is shown in example #3 below.

# 3 Subordination via verb ending -ham2 + PST subordinate verb
Judgement: g
mam2 bat bal2uham2, mam2 pot2 ka2n2wa
ma-m2 pot-2 bal2-u-ham2, ma-m2 bat ka-n2-wa
1SG-NOM book-SG read-PST-while, 1SG-NOM rice eat-NPT-IND
`When I read the book, I eat rice`

Based on the parse chart, the first step that is not able to unify
is with the SUBJ-HEAD rule. kaddi cannot unify in this rule because it
has the FLAG value for tense-pc as - when they need to be na-or-+.
After determining that it seems we may need a zero-affix rule for
when the tense is not specified on a verb. It was suggested that we update the pc
for -ddi such that it attaches directly to the root instead of a non-affixing
lexical tense rule, but we will need to include that next week.
# 3 with -ham2 does not work starting with the fact that bal2uham2 is not
morphologically created. I was able to interactively unify the stem bal2 with
the appropriate position classes until attempting the while-pst rule that
failed because of the forms not matching: while vs finite. This is also an update
we need to make for next week where we rework where [FORM fin] comes in, perhaps
removing it from the past tense rule. I am confused as to how we customize the grammar
so that the resulting S has FORM fin, not while.

All examples show that the subordinate clause precedes the main clause.

Clauses of cause and reason (because/since) are mainly formed with case markers
or inflection plus a particle. Two examples of particles are hinda and nissa which behave
identically. These particles both occur with PST or NPT adjectival
(this is the terrm used in the source) forms of the subordinate
verb in cases of dynamic verbs, not stative verbs (i.e. not forms of "be"). There is also another
particle ko12 which behaves the same as these but is used for temporal clauses like the affixes above.
We did not include it to keep our strategies smaller.

In example #13, nissa follows the subordinate clause and precedes the main clause.
It takes the NPT.ADJ form of eat. *This sentence will not parse because we have not
completed our implementation of free subordinate morphemes.

# 13 Subordination via particle nissa
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2 nissa mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2 nissa ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

These were implemented as free subordinator morphemes that appear after the S
they attach to, as heads.
Similarly to the bound morphemes, we gave them a new feature but since they are
not verbs, they do not take a FORM feature. We instead are considering giving them
Mood ADJ if we proceed with implementing that as a mood. When we attempted to do this,
there was an error loading the grammar that said ADJECTIVAL-CLAUSE-FINAL-PREHEAD-NONPAST-SUBORD-LEX-ITEM
has an invalid constraint, (which was the mood) with no further information.
We have discussed adding adj to the mood-pc with no affix that attaches a new nonfinte
FORM adj, update the other mood lexical rules to specify FORM finite, and
have the subordinator morpheme requirer [TENSE non-past] and [FORM adj].
Again, this is something we need to test out next week. We unfortunately ran out
of time and wanted to get as much as we could of the other features working first.

We did not get around to implementing the case markers, so the followiing
examples will not parse. They seem characteristic
of nominalization. The options are the dative -12 or the instrumental/ablative
-in suffix which are affixed to the PST or NPT form of subordinate verb.
Here are both examples in our testsuite.

# 6 Subordination via dative verb casing + non-past subordinate verb
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2wa12 mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2-wa-12 ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT-IND-DAT 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

# 8 Subordination with instrumental verb casing + past subordinate verb
Judgement: g
oyaa pot2 bal2wain mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa pot-2 bal2-u-wa-in ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM book-SG read-PST-IND-INS 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you read the book`

Finally, there is another strategy which is simply the past participle
construction which shows sequential relation of cause and effect.
This was not included as a strategy in the customization system though.

An example of this is (It DOES parse, but via asyndetonic
S coordination instead, which is not syntactically incorrect. It coordinates
"The house went" and "The dog read the book"):
# 17 Subordination via PP construction
Judgement: g
balla pot2 bal2la ged2r2 yauwa
ball-a pot-2 bal2-la ged2r-2 ya-u-wa
dog.NOM-SG book.NOM-SG read-PP house.NOM-SG go-PST-IND
`The dog went home because he had read a book`

There are other types of complemental clauses as well that are not included in our
grammar that correspond to conditional (if), concession (although), purpose (to),
and more.

Customization Matrix Only:
We have added nominalization in the customization system but have not tested it yet. We also were only able
to find a couple examples of explicit nominalization in our sources.
This was matrix only this week. There are no examples in the testsuite.
With nominalization, the highest argument of the verb must have genitive case once the verb is nominalized and the
highest argument can never be the patient argument of a transitive verb. The highest argument cannot have nominative
case when the verb is nominalized as nominalized verbs do not assign nominative case in Sinhala. Genitive marking on
the object is not acceptable. Nominalization applies to verbal predicates only. According to our sources, nominalization
is restricted to verbs only and is a inflectional morphology process. This means the verb is suffixed with 'ek2' or
'iim2' and the nominalized verb does not have a tense affix.

Since this is matrix only, we only added to the nominalized clause section of the matrix. We added a Nominalization
strategy where the nominalization of the clause occurs on the verb. We also stated that it should be reflected in the
semantics because genitive case under nominalization is considered to have the highest semantic role.

section=nominalclause
  ns1_name=verb-nom-strat
  ns1_level=low
  ns1_nmzRel=yes


Argument Optionality:

Sinhala is referred to as a "super pro-drop" language by two of our sources.
However, neither goes into extensive detail and perhaps that is because the language
is so free (free word order, no verb subject/object agreement).
The first source discusses it with regards to ellipsis where NPs including
the subject and object are often omitted and the most freely deleted subjects are
first and second pronouns, usually because they are contextual in a spoken/written conversation.

These examples show no subject, no object, and both missing respectively.

# 3 No subject
Judgement: g
bat gatta
bat gan-u-wa
rice buy-PST-IND
`(I) bought rice`

# 4 No object
Judgement: g
eyaa gatta
eyaa gan-u-wa
3SG.NOM buy-PST-IND
`She bought (it)`

# 2 No subject or object declarative
Judgement: g
gatta
gan-u-wa
buy-PST-IND
`I bought it`

This allows for a lot of ambiguity because when parsing, since it is possible
to posit any pronoun as the subject given that Sinhala doesn't have
any subject verb agreement. The subject of example #3 could be I, we, you, she,
they... The second source refers to pro-drop as null
anaphora and declares that arguments can be freely omitted in all argument
positions except for complements of postpositional phrases. This exception
has not been included in the grammar this week. This extensive pro-drop
is more prevalent in spoken Sinhala and more often than not, allowed.

Another scenario is where Sinhala allows the deletion of non-nominative elements
if they are obvious in context. This is the case with "experiencer" subjects that
are in the dative case. The following examples show how the Assertion Marker (AM)
works with adjectives to form a sentence with no subject (as well as no verb).

# 7 Assertion marker with non-assumed subject
# (This does not parse because non-verbal predicates are not part of the starter grammar
so we haven't included the assertion marker morpheme either)
Judgement: g
siit2lai
sitt2la-i
cold-AM
`It's cold / I feel cold` # Cold

Similarly, weather predicates do not require a subject.

# 8 No Subject, intransitive verb
Judgement: g
wahin2wa
wahi-n2-wa
rain-NPT-IND
`It's raining`

Interestingly, Sinhala also allows verb dropping with the existential or
possessive verbs inn2wa and tiyen2wa. This was not included in the grammar
because it is not the same as argument optionality but it is included here
just for curiosity.

n55, taatta ged2r2 n55
no, father home no
`No, father isn't home`

In the customization system, pro-drop was implemented for subjects and objects
with any verb, and no subject markers permitted when dropped or not. There are
no markers on the verbs in any pro-drop instances. The assertion marker
does not represent any information for the missing argument. It is a separate
feature. There was no evidence of contexts in which pro-drop was forbidden
except for the complements of postpositions as mentioned above, but the sources
did not provide any examples of this. We may be able to refine later if more
information is found, but for now, the argument optionality is extremely free
in our colloquial Sinhala grammar. Also for this reason, we did not need to
include OPT or other ARG features in the lexicon and morphology as mentioned
on the customization system.

section=arg-opt
subj-drop=subj-drop-all
subj-mark-drop=subj-mark-drop-not
subj-mark-no-drop=subj-mark-no-drop-not
subj-con=subj-con-always
obj-drop=obj-drop-all
obj-mark-drop=obj-mark-drop-not
obj-mark-no-drop=obj-mark-no-drop-not

Because of this freedom in colloquial Sinhala, we were unable to think of
any ungrammatical examples for this in the testsuite.


3. There are a few areas where the customization is not
fully equipped to work on Sinhala. Firstly (and this is
carry over from last week's lab but keeping here as a reminder),
the language shows coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic. We also will need something that says that adjectives
cannot modify pronouns which will need to be done in TDL editing with a
[ PRON bool ] feature and have the adjectives require their MOD to be
[ PRON - ] while the pronouns say that they are [ PRON + ].

Things that we did not get around to that are in the testsuite
(exception being #1 because we don't have evidence for it):
1. Incorporating agreement in case for coordinated NPs depending on
INVOL of verbs to answer the question of what happens if you coordinate
ANIM and INANIM subjects with a VOL intransitive verb, or if the case constraints
would restrict this.
2. Adjectival form (mentioned)
3. Need to fix the embedded clauses and adverbial modifiers

4. Our metrics are as follows:
Coverage: 39.2 % (Sadly this was at 44.2, but I must have changed something last minute!)
Overgeneration: 27.3 %
Ambiguity: We were unable to find a numeric value for this anywhere.. but there
was certainly a good amount of ambiguity in the scenarios where we got a lot of parses.

We knowingly have a lot of sentences in the testsuite that are not expected
to parse yet, due to not being expected in the starter grammar (nonverbal predicates,
and matrix-wh questions, interrogative complements for example).
Reasons for lower coverage: (some were mentioned in the examples in 1./2.)
- sentences that have the dative "to the shop" are not yet included in the grammar
- our three auxiliaries do not yet work. They are built up morphologically correct
but then do not combine with the verb constituent that they apply to.
- "mee" is a demonstrative pronoun that hasn't been implemented

# 8 AUX preceding verb
Judgement: u
balla bat tien2wa kaala
ball-a bat tie-n2-wa ka-la
dog.NOM-SG rice.NOM be-NPT-IND eat-PP
`The dog has eaten the rice`

Things that DID parse that did not in our write up last week.
- Both forms of negation
- Our new focus feature/morph rule

# 7 newei focus negator, implying alternative
Judgement: g
miniha kan2wa newei, gilin2wa
minih-a ka-n2-wa newei, gili-n2-wa
man.NOM-SG eat-NPT-IND not devour-NPT-IND
`The man is not eating, he's devouring`

# 9 n55 verbal negator
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
balla bonne n55
ball-a bo-nn-e n55
dog.NOM-SG drink-NPT-FOC no
`The dog does not drink`

Some of our sentences generate a lot of parses. It is not a surprise given for
one the lack of subject/verb or verb/object agreement, as well as
asyndetonic verb coordination. Also, because
pro-drop is common, sentences like "bat gan-u-wa" (above) give 20 parses
so it's possible that the verb undergoes multiple paths of morphology
for the different possible subject/object case constraints.
It's important to note that in cases of many parses, it is not the case
that each is a different parse structure which would indicate a lot of
ambiguity, but rather different possible non-affixing lexical rules that
produce the same surface structure.
An area of concern in our parse results are the sentences of subordination
that use free morphemes like "hinda" and "nissa" or use verb casing.
Right now since these are not incorporated, the sentences like:

# 12 Subordination without particle hinda
Judgement: u
oyaa bat kan2 mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2 ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.ADJ 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

are parsing (and with nearly 1000 parses) when they should not, or at least
not in the way that they are, likely because of coordination rather than
subordination of clauses. The parses show coordination of the phrases
(but I did not look through all of them).

It is clear we need to clean up some non affixing morphology rules.

5. All of the changes that we made to our grammar from last week are mentioned
in the first section with specific examples. In terms of what we real-time
updated as we have been testing this week - The biggest fixes were with
our case constraint position classes. A lot of our verbs were not unifying
in the SUBJ-HEAD or COMPS-HEAD rules because their flags were - for
case constraints pc. Thus they were not morphologically complete.
This is because we had two pc classes for this that did not handle intransitive verbs.
They were not handled because they were assume to not have objects. However,
because the class was obligatory and the verb didn't meet meet the criteria of
the specific rule types (i.e. didn't have an object), the class was not satisfied
so we added two non-affixing rules (one for vol and one for invol verb pcs).
This opened up a lot of sentences to parse better. We also greatly improved
from last week by correctly implementing lexical rules for verbs we were
deeming irregular that just needed to be analyzed the same as the rest.


Extra Questions:
1. What does "complements of postpositional phrases" mean?
