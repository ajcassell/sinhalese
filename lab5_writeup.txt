1. The three things we chose to focus on refining this week were clausal complements,
adverbial modifiers, and possessives. In addition, we were able to get some coordination
working better.

Adverbial Modifiers:
The modifier strategy that uses the affixes -ddi and -ham2 were not working
because of a FORM mismatch since -ddi contributes [ FORM while ]. In order to
fix this, we took [ FORM fin ] off of the pst-vol lex rule to prevent the
mismatch. We also made the tense-pc optional and updated the adverbial
modifier to attach directly to the verb stem and to attach to S only,
not VP only in the customization system.

cms1_position=before
cms1_modifier-attach=s
cms1_subordinator=none
cms1_pred=_while_subord_rel
  cms1_feat1_name=form
  cms1_feat1_value=while

An example that parses with this is:

# 1 Subordination via verb ending -ddi
Judgement: g
balla kaddi mam2 pot2 bal2n2wa
ball-a ka-ddi ma-m2 pot-2 bal2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG eat-while 1SG-NOM book-SG read-NPT-IND
`While the dog is eating, I read the book`

There are ambiguous results, at least two of which are because the subject and
object case can both be nominative so for each SUBJ-HEAD instance in each clause
for this example, there is also a corresponding parse that uses COMP-HEAD instead.

We were able to then also add the free subordinator morphemes: ko12, nissa, and hinda.
nissa and hinda are used for cause whereas ko12 is used for temporal relations.
These free subordinators require the subordinate verb to be in adjectival form
(and in response to last week's feedback, this is indeed what the sources call it).
They define it as a non-finite form that is inflected through non-finite or connective
suffixes. We created a value of FORM adj-form, subtype of non-finite.
Instead of making adjectival a mood, since our mood-pc is optional and this
is non-affixing so it would have made that an option on all of our verb morphemes,
we made adjectival-pst and adjectival-npt rules on the tense-pc that require the
respective PST and NPT tenses on the verb and take no affix. They also require
[ FORM adjectival ] on these two rules but not on the other tense rules.
The morphemes themselves also require [ FORM adjectival ].

cms2_position=before
cms2_modifier-attach=either
cms2_subordinator=free
cms2_subposition=after
cms2_subordinator-type=head
  cms2_freemorph1_orth=hinda
  cms2_freemorph1_pred=_because_subord_rel
  cms2_freemorph2_orth=nissa
  cms2_freemorph2_pred=_because_subord_rel
  cms2_freemorph3_orth=ko12
  cms2_freemorph3_pred=_while_subord_rel
  cms2_feat1_name=form
  cms2_feat1_value=adjectival

Examples to follow for each:

# 13 Subordination via particle nissa
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2 nissa mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2 nissa ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

# 11 Subordination via particle hinda, PST
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kaalaa hinda mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-u hinda ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-PST.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you ate rice`

# 4 Subordination via ko12 particle + Adjectival form
Judgement: g
mam2 bal2n2 ko12 mam2 bat k55wa
ma-m2 bal2-n2 ko12 ma-m2 bat ka-u-wa
1SG-NOM read-NPT.ADJ when 1SG-NOM rice eat-PST-IND
`While I was reading, I ate rice`

In Lab 4, asyndetonic coordination of VPs was allowing these to parse
without this implementation but we removed that and our overgeneration
was cut down by half and there are no longer examples with nearly 1000
parses (some still have many though).

Clausal Complements:
Our clausal complements were not working because the dec-clausal verbs
were flagged - for the vol-trans-obj case constraint position class being skipped.
This is because we had chosen to have the dec-clausal verbs go through the
transitive morphological rules instead of intransitive, thinking that the CP
would be the object. This is however not the case and would result in this
pc being skipped because there were no case constraints that could be applied to
a CP, since inherently those are meant for nouns and objects of transitive
verbs are also meant to be nouns. Since the complement is "verby" and the
case constraint pc constrains CASE on the complement, it could not unify.
So we switched to intransitive lexical rules and it worked!

verb11_name=dec-clausal
  verb11_feat1_name=INVOL
  verb11_feat1_value=-
  verb11_feat1_head=verb

section=clausal-comp
  comps1_clause-pos-same=on
  comps1_ques=prop
  comps1_comp-pos-after=on
  comps1_comp=oblig
    comps1_stem1_orth=baw2
    comps1_stem2_orth=ki2la

verb-pc16_inputs=verb10, verb11
  verb-pc16_lrt1_name=vol-intrans-agent
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat1_name=case
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat1_value=a_case
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat1_head=subj
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat2_name=gender
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat2_value=animate, inanimate
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat2_head=subj
    verb-pc16_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=no

Now the vol-intrans-agent-cc-pc takes dec-clausal verbs as input as well (verb11).

Examples that now parse:

# 1 Declarative Clausal Complement, baw2 subordinating conjunction, complement precedes main
Judgement: g
balla bat kan2wa baw2 eyaa dann2wa
ball-a bat ka-n2-wa baw2 eyaa dan-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND that.QM 3.SG know-NPT-IND
`She knows that the dog eats rice`

# 4 Declarative Clausal Complement with ki2la formal noun
Judgement: g
balla bat k55wa ki2la eyaa hit2n2wa
ball-a bat ka-u-wa ki2la eyaa hit2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-PST-IND QM 3.SG think-NPT-IND
`She thinks that the dog ate rice`

Possessives:
Sinhala utilizes genitive case to express possession. For possessives in the adnomial possession section,
we previously stated morphemes appear on the possessor as an affix. This meant we had to define a possessive
noun position class in the morphology section. This method did not capture all our possessives and many of
the ungrammatical examples parsed. Thus, we removed that possessive strategy in the adnomial possession section
and replaced it with a strategy that states no possessive morphemes appear, but that there are constraints on
the features of the possessor. This constraint is genitive case. Since we already had a case position class in
morphology, we utilized this pre-existing position class and removed the possessive position class we had created
for Lab 4. Genitive was already present in the case position class, so we simply added one additional affix
'-gee' that we did not have prior and removed the '-ee' that corresponds to inanimates. We then created a
genitive-inanim-rule so inanimates would only take the inanimate affixes, rather than incorrectly taking
both animate and inanimate suffixes as they were in Lab 4.

section=adnom-poss
  poss-strat2_order=head-final
  poss-strat2_mod-spec=spec
  poss-strat2_mark-loc=neither
  poss-strat2_pronoun-allow=yes
    poss-strat2_feat1_name=case
    poss-strat2_feat1_value=genitive

section=morphology

    noun-pc3_lrt3_name=genitive-rule
      noun-pc3_lrt3_feat1_name=case
      noun-pc3_lrt3_feat1_value=genitive
      noun-pc3_lrt3_feat1_head=itself
      noun-pc3_lrt3_forbid1_others=noun1
      noun-pc3_lrt3_lri1_inflecting=yes
      noun-pc3_lrt3_lri1_orth=-gee
      noun-pc3_lrt3_lri2_inflecting=yes
      noun-pc3_lrt3_lri2_orth=-ge
    noun-pc3_lrt5_name=genitive-inanim-rule
      noun-pc3_lrt5_feat2_name=case

      noun-pc3_lrt5_feat2_head=itself
      noun-pc3_lrt5_require1_others=noun1
      noun-pc3_lrt5_lri1_inflecting=yes
      noun-pc3_lrt5_lri1_orth=-ee

These now correctly parse:

# 1 Inanimate Locative Possession
Judgement: g
mam2 potee pitu bal2n2wa
ma-m2 pot-ee pitu bal2-n2-wa
1SG-NOM book-LOC page.PL read-NPT-IND
`I read the pages of the book`

#9 Pronominal Possession
Judgement: g
mage balla bat kan2wa
ma-ge ball-a bat ka-n2-wa
I.SG-GEN dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND
`My dog eats rice`

This correctly does NOT parse:
#10 Pronominal Possession, incorrect case on possessor
Judgement: u
maee balla bat kan2wa
ma-ee ball-a bat ka-n2-wa
I.SG-LOC dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND
`My dog eats rice`


2. We had two suggested TDL edits, but only proceeded with one. The one we
implemented was to adjectives to not be able to modify pronouns.
This was a simple change - we added PRON - as a restriction on the modifier
of adjectives with the following snippet:

attr-adj-lex := adj-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD noun &
                                                  [ PRON - ],
                                                    VAL.SPR cons ] ] > ].

This is evidenced with the following example, that was parsing without this TDL edit
last week. This example is ungrammatical because of the order of the cardinal
adjective but it was parsing because "ma-m2 dek2" was unifying as an NP
even though the ADJ "two" (ma-m2) should not modify the pronoun "ma-m2".
Now it does not parse, which is expected behavior!

# 9 Cardinal Numeral Adjective, incorrect cardinal order, cardinal number precedes noun
Judgement: u
mam2 dek2 gas gatta
ma-m2 dek2 gas gan-u-wa
1SG-NOM two tree.PL buy-PST-IND
I bought two trees

The second need for TDL edits was for coordination of VPs and S which was
called participle coordination. Essentially, this is when there are two
or more verbs and the last verb is required to be PST and all the verbs
preceding are past participles. This is to indicate the temporal order
of events. For the time being it was left as an asyndetonic strategy
but this caused a lot of overgeneration (we think) where sentences
were parsing that should not. For example, this happened with our coordination
strategies. Regardless, we did not implement this because it seems
that it would be handled in the asyndetonic strategy anyways since each
clause with a verb can parse independently (especially given Sinhala's
pro-drop which allows the subject to be shared between clauses)
and then be coordinated. This is an assumption and we did not try it out.

# Does not parse

mam2 ged2r2 gihilla k55m2 k55wa
ma-m2 ged2r-2 ya-la k55m-2 ka-u-wa
1SG-NOM house.ACC-SG go-PP food.ACC-SG eat-PST-IND
`I went home and ate`


3. MMT
To collect MMT sentences, we first found translations for all of the vocabulary in the eng.txt
file. Two of the words in the vocabulary were not in our resources. The words "park" and "chase"
we replaced with "yard" and "watch", respectively. In creating the vocabulary, we attempted to
include all possible verb tense and mood variations for all verbs, including past, nonpast, and
focus structure. We then created sentences based on the vocabulary and phenomena already present
in our testsuite/choices file.

We skipped two sentences in the eng.txt: "Dogs in the park eat "and "The dog sleeps after the cat
sleeps". The construction of the first sentence is not one we found in our resources. The second
sentence involves phenomena we do not expect to get to. "passe", meaning "after", is more complicated
to model. It requires a past tense verb form with dative case. Our resources do not show this verb in
past tense alone, which of course we could attempt to model given other past tense examples. Past tense
for this verb is commonly associated with reflexives, which we are not modeling, and therefore think
modeling the final sentence of eng.txt will not be possible.

Other sentences that may not be possible to model due to phenomena include the following:
1. balla ba32ginii -> The dogs are hungry
2. balla midule inn2wa -> The dogs are in the park
3. balla puusa inn2wa -> The dogs are the cats
4. nid2nne kaud2 - > Who sleeps
5. balla bal2nne mon2wad2 -> What do the dogs watch
6. balla bal2n2wa oyaa hi2nne mon2wad2 -> What do you think the dogs watch
7. balla mon2wad2 bal2nne 5huwe kaud2 -> Who asked what the dogs watch
8. mam2 5huwa balla bal2n2wa d2 ki2la -> I asked what the dogs watched

The first sentence is a non-verbal predicate, a phenomena we have no yet covered. We do not expect to
model this sentence. The second and third sentences are also considered non-verbal, but both contain a
verb that, once added to the choices file, could be modelled. Sentences 4-8 will be impossible to
translate because they involve wh words, a phenomena we did not address in our grammar.


4. First Translation
We worked on the VM for the translations. We first tested translate-line.sh without changing the
commented out sections and our results mimicked those from lecture on 2/6. We then chose the full
pipeline, which resulted in two translated sentences in the terminal without additional notes. The
second option was "full pipeline; errors from last step" which resulted the two translations in
addition to notes about the passives built and the sentence transfer. We also chose to look at the
transfer output. This resulted in a MRS only. Lastly, we chose the parser output, which resulted in
a longer MRS (at least compared to the transfer output) and the terminal stated the test sentence
used.

Steps 4-7 presented issues for both of us. We received messages two messages: "ln: failed to create
symbolic link" and "ace/config.td: no such file or directory". We debugged this by using the absolute
source path in the ln command. This solved both error messages and we were easily able to translate
the first sentence from English into Sinhala! Our output was extensive, with 450 translations, but the
output included the correct translation. Clearly, most of these translations are not accurate. It appears
it applied every rule with every affix. The first translation is "ball-aa-ek nid2-wa". This translation
incorrectly applied our sg-anim-masc rule adding the -aa to "ball", followed by the indef-rule which added
-ek. For "nid2-wa", it incorrectly skipped our npt tense rule that would have added "-n2" as the first affix
on the verb. Instead, only the ind mood rule was applied.

We think the excessive number of translations is due to our morphological rules and the number of affixing
and non-affixing rules we have. We attempted to reduce the number of rules in our grammar while retaining
accuracy but this broke our grammar. We hope to better resolve this issue in the next lab.


5. Final Grammar Performance
After all the changes to the starter grammar this week, 123 of the 188 of the items
parsed. We now have 63.4% coverage compared to Lab 4's 39.2%!

Overgeneration was 27.3 % in Lab 4 and is now 12.3% for Lab 5!

The average number of parses per parsed item in Lab 5 is 10.44, taken from the distinct
analyses listed under coverage.

Lab 5 ambiguity is now 10.25! This is a huge change from Lab 4, where ambiguity was
46.87. The most ambiguous item in Lab 5 had 232 parses, shown below.

# 2 Conjunctive coordination - clitic i between units of coordination
Judgement: g
guruw2rui demaupiyoi lam2inui paar2 bal2n2wa
guruw2r-u i demaupiy-o i lam2in-u i paar-2 bal2-n2-wa
teacher-PL CONJ parent-PL CONJ child-PL CONJ road-SG watch-NPT-IND
`The teachers, parents and children watch the road`

Last week, this example parsed with 760 parses. We were able to greatly reduce total
ambiguity, but the parse count is still very high. We noticed these issues stem from
various rules being applied, especially with coordination rules. For example, one tree
shows the VP formed by the Complement Head Rule whereas another tree shows a V instead
formed by the Subject Head Rule. In terms of coordination rules, we noticed left coord,
top coord, mid coord, and bottom coord continue to be key differences among the trees.
Lastly, we noted the ungrammatical versions of this sentence parse with significantly
lower parse counts than the grammatical example.

For ambiguity, we think some of our case constraint and non-affixing rules might be
causing some continued ambiguity. The high volume of trees is likely due in part to the
multiple morphological rules that we might be able to clean up better. We think this is
definitely part of our coordination issues. Even the saha noun coordinator has 97 parses:

# 8 Conjunctive coordination - saha noun-coordinator
Judgement: g
mam2 saha eyaa bat kan2wa
ma-m2 saha eyaa bat ka-n2-wa
1SG-NOM and 3SG.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`He and I eat rice`

These sentences also parse, but with higher parse totals compared to the rest of the
testsuite with 44 parses each. All these sentences are grammatical, but have the same
aforementioned ambiguity issues:

# 10 Subordination via particle hinda, NPT
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2 hinda mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2 hinda ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

# 13 Subordination via particle nissa
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2 nissa mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2 nissa ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

We thought free word order would result in multiple parses and more
ambiguity. We realized this is not always true because of the case constraints on the
subject and objects corresponding to specific verb types. For example, if an involitive
verb has an animate subject that is case DAT and has an animate object that is case NOM,
free word order does not apply. That is, the case constraints do not allow the subject
and object to be switched.

Referring back to MMT, our first test sentence "ball-o nid2-n2-wa" had 186 translations.
As previously mentioned, the majority of these translations were the product of applying
ALL our morphological rules, even when they should not have applied. This leads us to
think we should attempt to resolve more of our ambiguity to potentially mitigate the
excessive number of translations. This is just a theory we have but it might not be
accurate.
