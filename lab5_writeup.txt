1. The three things we chose to focus on refining this week were clausal complements,
adverbial modifiers, and possessives. In addition, we were able to get some coordination
working better.

Adverbial Modifiers:
The modifier strategy that uses the affixes -ddi and -ham2 were not working
because of a FORM mismatch since -ddi contributes [ FORM while ]. In order to
fix this, we took [ FORM fin ] off of the pst-vol lex rule to prevent the
mismatch. We also made the tense-pc optional and updated the adverbial
modifier to attach directly to the verb stem and to attach to S only,
not VP only in the customization system.

cms1_position=before
cms1_modifier-attach=s
cms1_subordinator=none
cms1_pred=_while_subord_rel
  cms1_feat1_name=form
  cms1_feat1_value=while

An example that parses with this is:

# 1 Subordination via verb ending -ddi
Judgement: g
balla kaddi mam2 pot2 bal2n2wa
ball-a ka-ddi ma-m2 pot-2 bal2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG eat-while 1SG-NOM book-SG read-NPT-IND
`While the dog is eating, I read the book`

There are ambiguous results, at least two of which are because the subject and
object case can both be nominative so for each SUBJ-HEAD instance in each clause
for this example, there is also a corresponding parse that uses COMP-HEAD instead.

We were able to then also add the free subordinator morphemes: ko12, nissa, and hinda.
nissa and hinda are used for cause whereas ko12 is used for temporal relations.
These free subordinators require the subordinate verb to be in adjectival form
(and in response to last week's feedback, this is indeed what the sources call it).
They define it as a non-finite form that is inflected through non-finite or connective
suffixes. We created a value of FORM adj-form, subtype of non-finite.
Instead of making adjectival a mood, since our mood-pc is optional and this
is non-affixing so it would have made that an option on all of our verb morphemes,
we made adjectival-pst and adjectival-npt rules on the tense-pc that require the
respective PST and NPT tenses on the verb and take no affix. They also require
[ FORM adjectival ] on these two rules but not on the other tense rules.
The morphemes themselves also require [ FORM adjectival ].

cms2_position=before
cms2_modifier-attach=either
cms2_subordinator=free
cms2_subposition=after
cms2_subordinator-type=head
  cms2_freemorph1_orth=hinda
  cms2_freemorph1_pred=_because_subord_rel
  cms2_freemorph2_orth=nissa
  cms2_freemorph2_pred=_because_subord_rel
  cms2_freemorph3_orth=ko12
  cms2_freemorph3_pred=_while_subord_rel
  cms2_feat1_name=form
  cms2_feat1_value=adjectival

Examples to follow for each:

# 13 Subordination via particle nissa
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kan2 nissa mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-n2 nissa ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you eat rice`

# 11 Subordination via particle hinda, PST
Judgement: g
oyaa bat kaalaa hinda mam2 sudd2k2n2wa
oyaa bat ka-u hinda ma-m2 sudd2k2-n2-wa
2SG.NOM rice eat-PST.ADJ since 1SG-NOM clean-NPT-IND
`I clean because you ate rice`

# 4 Subordination via ko12 particle + Adjectival form
Judgement: g
mam2 bal2n2 ko12 mam2 bat k55wa
ma-m2 bal2-n2 ko12 ma-m2 bat ka-u-wa
1SG-NOM read-NPT.ADJ when 1SG-NOM rice eat-PST-IND
`While I was reading, I ate rice`

In Lab 4, asyndetonic coordination of VPs was allowing these to parse
without this implementation but we removed that and our overgeneration
was cut down by half and there are no longer examples with nearly 1000
parses (some still have many though).

Clausal Complements:
Our clausal complements were not working because the dec-clausal verbs
were flagged - for the vol-trans-obj case constraint position class being skipped.
This is because we had chosen to have the dec-clausal verbs go through the
transitive morphological rules instead of intransitive, thinking that the CP
would be the object. This is however not the case and would result in this
pc being skipped because there were no case constraints that could be applied to
a CP, since inherently those are meant for nouns and objects of transitive
verbs are also meant to be nouns. Since the complement is "verby" and the
case constraint pc constrains CASE on the complement, it could not unify.
So we switched to intransitive lexical rules and it worked!

verb11_name=dec-clausal
  verb11_feat1_name=INVOL
  verb11_feat1_value=-
  verb11_feat1_head=verb

section=clausal-comp
  comps1_clause-pos-same=on
  comps1_ques=prop
  comps1_comp-pos-after=on
  comps1_comp=oblig
    comps1_stem1_orth=baw2
    comps1_stem2_orth=ki2la

verb-pc16_inputs=verb10, verb11
  verb-pc16_lrt1_name=vol-intrans-agent
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat1_name=case
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat1_value=a_case
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat1_head=subj
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat2_name=gender
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat2_value=animate, inanimate
    verb-pc16_lrt1_feat2_head=subj
    verb-pc16_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=no

Now the vol-intrans-agent-cc-pc takes dec-clausal verbs as input as well (verb11).

Examples that now parse:

# 1 Declarative Clausal Complement, baw2 subordinating conjunction, complement precedes main
Judgement: g
balla bat kan2wa baw2 eyaa dann2wa
ball-a bat ka-n2-wa baw2 eyaa dan-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-NPT-IND that.QM 3.SG know-NPT-IND
`She knows that the dog eats rice`

# 4 Declarative Clausal Complement with ki2la formal noun
Judgement: g
balla bat k55wa ki2la eyaa hit2n2wa
ball-a bat ka-u-wa ki2la eyaa hit2-n2-wa
dog.NOM-SG rice eat-PST-IND QM 3.SG think-NPT-IND
`She thinks that the dog ate rice`


2. We had two suggested TDL edits, but only proceeded with one. The one we
implemented was to adjectives to not be able to modify pronouns.
This was a simple change - we added PRON - as a restriction on the modifier
of adjectives with the following snippet:

attr-adj-lex := adj-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD noun &
                                                  [ PRON - ],
                                                    VAL.SPR cons ] ] > ].

This is evidenced with the following example, that was parsing without this TDL edit
last week. This example is ungrammatical because of the order of the cardinal
adjective but it was parsing because "ma-m2 dek2" was unifying as an NP
even though the ADJ "two" (ma-m2) should not modify the pronoun "ma-m2".
Now it does not parse, which is expected behavior!

# 9 Cardinal Numeral Adjective, incorrect cardinal order, cardinal number precedes noun
Judgement: u
mam2 dek2 gas gatta
ma-m2 dek2 gas gan-u-wa
1SG-NOM two tree.PL buy-PST-IND
I bought two trees

The second need for TDL edits was for coordination of VPs and S which was
called participle coordination. Essentially, this is when there are two
or more verbs and the last verb is required to be PST and all the verbs
preceding are past participles. This is to indicate the temporal order
of events. For the time being it was left as an asyndetonic strategy
but this caused a lot of overgeneration (we think) where sentences
were parsing that should not. For example, this happened with our coordination
strategies. Regardless, we did not implement this because it seems
that it would be handled in the asyndetonic strategy anyways since each
clause with a verb can parse independently (especially given Sinhala's
pro-drop which allows the subject to be shared between clauses)
and then be coordinated. This is an assumption and we did not try it out.

# Does not parse
Judgement: g
mam2 ged2r2 gihilla k55m2 k55wa
ma-m2 ged2r-2 ya-la k55m-2 ka-u-wa
1SG-NOM house.ACC-SG go-PP food.ACC-SG eat-PST-IND
`I went home and ate`
