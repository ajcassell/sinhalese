MMT section:

To collect MMT sentences, we first found translations for all of the vocabulary in the eng.txt
file. Two of the words in the vocabulary were not in our resources. The words "park" and "chase"
we replaced with "yard" and "watch", respectively. In creating the vocabulary, we attempted to
include all possible verb tense and mood variations for all verbs, including past, nonpast, and
focus structure. We then created sentences based on the vocabulary and phenomena already present
in our testsuite/choices file.

We skipped two sentences in the eng.txt: "Dogs in the park eat "and "The dog sleeps after the cat
sleeps". The construction of the first sentence is not one we found in our resources. The second
sentence involves phenomena we do not expect to get to. "passe", meaning "after", is more complicated
to model. It requires a past tense verb form with dative case. Our resources do not show this verb in
past tense alone, which of course we could attempt to model given other past tense examples. Past tense
is commonly associated with reflexives, which we are not modeling, and therefore think modeling the
final sentence of eng.txt will not be possible.

Other sentences that may not be possible to model due to phenomena include the following:
1. balla ba32ginii -> The dogs are hungry
2. balla midule inn2wa -> The dogs are in the park
3. balla puusa inn2wa -> The dogs are the cats


The first sentence is a non-verbal predicate, a phenomena we have no yet covered. We do not expect to
model this sentence. The second and third sentences are also considered non-verbal, but both contain a
verb that, once added to the choices file, could be modelled.


#should we skip the others in sin.txt or...?

#can we accurately model these two coordination constructions???? -- i think the translations are close
balla kaar bal2n2wa puusa balla bal2n2wa -> Dogs watch cars and cats watch dogs
puusa balla bal2n2wa nid2n2wa -> Cats watch dogs and sleep


To do:
# need to add vocab to choices file ----- repalcements
# update testsuite skeleton to reflect new testsuite.txt

First Translation:
We worked on the VM for the translations. We first tested translate-line.sh without changing the
commented out sections and our results mimicked those from lecture on 2/6. We then chose the full
pipeline, which resulted in two translated sentences in the terminal without additional notes. The
second option was "full pipeline; errors from last step" which resulted the two translations in
addition to notes about the passives built and the sentence transfer. We also chose to look at the
transfer output. This resulted in a MRS only. Lastly, we chose the parser output, which resulted in
a longer MRS (at least compared to the transfer output) and the terminal stated the test sentence
used.









Choices file improvements for 3 Phenomena:

Possessives:
For possessives in the adnomial possession section, we previously stated morphemes appear on the
possessor as an affix. This meant we had to define a possessive noun position class in the morphology
section. This method did not capture all our possessives and many of the ungrammatical examples parsed.
Thus, we removed that possessive strategy in the adnomial possession section and replaced it with a
strategy that states no possessive morphemes appear, but that there are constraints on the features of
the possessor. This constraint is genitive case. Since we already had a case position class in morphology,
we utilized this pre-existing position class and removed the possessive position class we had created for
Lab 4. Genitive was already present in the case position class, so we simply added one additional affix
'-gee' that we did not have prior and removed the '-ee' that corresponds to inanimates. We then created a
genitive-inanim-rule so inanimates would only take the inanimate affixes, rather than incorrectly taking
both animate and inanimate suffixes as they were in Lab 4.
