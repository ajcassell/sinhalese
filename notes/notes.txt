Examples:

Word Order:
- "relatively free" but also SOV
- adjectives and modifying/relative clauses precede noun
- highly consistent OV language such that subject need not be taken into consideration when
verbal modifiers are introduced
- exception: numbers follow noun
- negative particle added at end of clause - for adjectives, assertion marker -i is dropped,
for verbal clauses, the verb changes to FOC
- Sentential adverbs (ie. fortunately) are sentence-initial, otherwise just left of predicate
- aux verbs (ie. has, must, may) directly follow the associated verb
-vpg 12 Sinhalese (Chandralal): compound verbal predicates showing speaker's attiude - aux verb also follows main verb
- sometimes S and O can be omitted.. "bought?" for "did you buy it" or "I bought it" or if S is speaker "hungry".
- can also omit V "no, father home no"

- subject and object nouns in nominative case but colloquial could add accusative ending to object

Wh-questions:
- question particle (de) added to sentence-final position the basic declarative sentence for regular questions
- for wh-questions, wh word is sentence-final as well and verb changes from IND to FOC (focus)

Nouns:
- case, definitiveness, number
- common nouns divided into +/- animate
- only animate has acc, but otherwise 5 cases (nom, gen/loc, dat, acc, instrumental).. ablative??
- specific suffixes per case ending/animacy
- exist mass nouns - take plural form
- plural form of inanimate removes final vowel, inanimate takes different change

NP
- definitiveness: INDF ending, otherwise naturally definite ("the"), but these are morphological/affixes, not determiners
- modifiers come before nouns
- pronouns (this/that/those) are separate word determiners

Pronouns:
- 1sg, 1pl, 3sg, 3pl, and respect/ordinary/vulgar 2nd (sg and then pl so 6 total)
- 4 demonstrative ones (this, that, that (over there), that<-anaphoric) -  don't show definitiveness or number
- ^ 24 total demonstrative (8 inanimate, 8 animate, 8 human)
- do not vary by gender / no gender
- vary by person and number
- case????? confused by pronouns because text defines a 1sg, but then shows various forms/spellings
of it through the examples
- Grammatical Relations paper says yes to case (pg 70 shows some of the different forms)
------ didn't include the vulgar, respect options for second person in test suite

Adjectives:
- do not inflect for definitiveness, number, or case

Tense/aspect:
- stem plus suffix for non-past, suffix for indicative
- 3 types of verbs: active, passive, causative
- active has transitive and intransitive
- semi-transitive: objects appear in DAT case as indirect objects morphosyntactically

Verbs:
- do not show number, person, gender agreement
- volitive or involitive
- past and non past tense
- aspect: perfective, resultative, completive, inchoactive, processive, progressive, inceptive


-----------TO DO-----------
1. update references with proper citations
2. Change example numbers
3. go back to resultative and other aspects/tenses
4. figure out how to handle non-ASCII
5. question about the focus case option

---------QUESTIONS---------
1. Should we handle gender? a lot of changes are morphological, but this isn't with regards to agreement -- I don't think so...
because they would just be different noun lexical entries since the gender is insignificant for agreement, so we can just
pick one as an example to work with.

2. What do you do when there are grammatical and morphological changes? For example, verb eat = "ka". When it becomes past tense,
it is "kaa-la", with gloss eat-PP but in other scenarios the affix for some tense follows "ka" not "kaa" so clearly in the
PP regards, there is also a stem change? I'm having trouble determining what is going on and how to account for it.

3. If free word order, but heavily studied as SOV, which should we follow?

4. Can you explain this in the Word Order explanation section: "In some languages, full NPs are arguably always
adjuncts (topics, etc.) with the valence requirements of the verb being filled by affixes. If your language seems
to fall into this type, you should still try to find examples with full NPs illustrating where they can occur,
but please discuss this in your write up."

5. Are you just looking for personal pronouns of demonstrative ones as well like "this/that/those" etc. Our language has 24
of these..

6. Our determiners are affixes so that is morphological, right? How should we account for that?

7. What feature code for auxiliaries?






8. Not sure about this: Complements: The complements of auxiliaries are:
saturated sentences
VPs, raising the subject
Vs, raising all of its arguments (argument composition)

9. Should the test-suite have our transliterations also? pretty sure yes
