--------------------------------------------------------
Embedded Complement Clauses (declarative, interrogative)
--------------------------------------------------------

Complementizers - "formal nouns" like witti2, wag2 and baw2
- ^ obligatory it seems
Object complement is embedded between subject and predicate of main clause
Identical subject deleted, otherwise complement precedes main
Embedded clauses can also appear after or in the middle of main clauses, usually for pragmatics
- no special morphology on verb
- word order same between matrix and embedded clauses
- Are embedded clauses necessarily nominalized?? ----- my guess is no but idk what this means exactly

balla bat ka-n2wa baw2 kiiwa
dog.NOM rice eat-IND QM say.PAST
`The dog said "I eat rice."'

mam2 bat ka-n2wa baw2 balla dan-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.IND QM dog.NOM know-IND
`I know that the dog eats rice`

QM = quotative marker - used to embed reported speech or thought into the main clause (Direct Speech)
(but goes in the exact same place and nothing else changes? - maybe only QM can also do interrogative and imperatives)

mam2 bat ka-n2wa ki2la balla dan-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.IND QM dog.NOM know-IND
`I know that the dog eats rice`

balla bat ka-n2wa ki2la kiiwa
dog.NOM rice eat-IND QM say.PAST
`The dog said "I eat rice."'

mam2 balla-gen 5huwa bat ka-n2wa d2 ki2la
1SG.NOM dog-ABL ask.PST rice eat-IND Q QM
`I asked the dog whether he eats rice`

Other verbs QM works with are shouted, requested, was worried, muttered, promised, doubted, believed

Adverbial Clausal Modifiers
---------------------------

Subordination occurs through verbal endings,
inflectional form plus particles, and case markers.

-ddi "while" attaches directly to verb root for unspecified time
balla uya-ddi mam2 patt2ree bal2-n2wa
balla cook-while ma-m2 newspaper read-IND
`While the dog is cooking, I read a newspaper`

particle kot2 (while/when) for time as well

The tense of the unspecified temporal clauses in (78) is determined by the tense term
of the main clause. (a:198 examples)

gama4 (while/as soon as)
while - if subordinate clause is non-past tense
as soon as - if subordinate clause is past tense
(examples a:199)

All examples are showing the subordinate clause PRECEDES the regular clause

Clauses of cause and reason are mainly formed with case markers and inflection plus particles
hinda or nisaa. The case forms include the dative -12
and the instrumental/ablative -in which are suffixed to the past or non--past form of
the subordinate verb. (both tenses for both suffixes)
The particles occur with past or non-past adjectival forms of the verb.

Case on the VERB

oyaa gee sudd2 k2r2-n2wa-12 eyaa gewa-nn2 oon5
you house clean-IND-DAT he pay-INF must
`He must pay you for your cleaning the house`

ikm2n212 aawa-in no-temi beeruna
quickly come.PAST-INS not-get wet.PP be saved.PAST
`I was able to save myself without getting wet (from rain) since I came hurriedly`

hinda/nisaa - subordinate verb gets inflected for adjectival form if dynamic verb, not stative

Ranjit nidi hinda api kataa k2l-ee n55
Ranjit asleep since we call.PT-Poc no
`Since Ranjit was asleep we didn't call him`

Also the past participle construction to show sequential relation of cause and effect (200)

Not going to bring up ki2la

Also, conditional clauses (if), concession (although), purpose (to, infinitive), proportion, and manner

Lexicon to add!!
----------------
baw2
ki2la
d2
-ddi
-ham2
ko12
-in
hinda
nissa
.ADJ?

Adjectival form follows NPT and applies nothing?

PAST
gatta (stem is gan) - so gan-u-wa ?
k55wa k55-wa (stem is ka) - so ka-u-wa ?
dunna -> dun-u-wa ?
diwwa -> di-u-wa
aawa aa-wa -> aa-u-wa
5huwa -> 5h-u-wa
bal2wa bal2-wa -> bal2-u-wa
kiiwa -> ki-u-wa

INVOL  - maybe INVOLs have no? IND, and then different PST rules
5he-n2wa (hear)
diun-a (run)
n51un-a (dance)
k5dun-a (break)


PP
gihilla (ya)
5hila (hear.INV.PP)

ka-laa -> ka-la
gihilla -> ya-la
5hila -> 5he-la


la = PP (involitive trans & vol both)
laa = PAST (vol both for now)



Write up notes:
Adverbial Clausal Modifiers:
- more examples of while/as soon as/before until etc - didn't include this because they're extra and not enough time

TO FIX:
- vase ending doesn't match any listed
