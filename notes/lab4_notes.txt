--------------------------------------------------------
Embedded Complement Clauses (declarative, interrogative)
--------------------------------------------------------

Complementizers - "formal nouns" like witti2, wag2 and baw2
- ^ obligatory it seems
Object complement is embedded between subject and predicate of main clause
Identical subject deleted, otherwise complement precedes main
Embedded clauses can also appear after or in the middle of main clauses, usually for pragmatics
- no special morphology on verb
- word order same between matrix and embedded clauses
- Are embedded clauses necessarily nominalized?? ----- my guess is no but idk what this means exactly

balla bat ka-n2wa baw2 kiiwa
dog.NOM rice eat-IND QM say.PAST
`The dog said "I eat rice."'

mam2 bat ka-n2wa baw2 balla dan-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.IND QM dog.NOM know-IND
`I know that the dog eats rice`

QM = quotative marker - used to embed reported speech or thought into the main clause (Direct Speech)
(but goes in the exact same place and nothing else changes? - maybe only QM can also do interrogative and imperatives)

mam2 bat ka-n2wa ki2la balla dan-n2wa
1SG.NOM rice eat-NPT.IND QM dog.NOM know-IND
`I know that the dog eats rice`

balla bat ka-n2wa ki2la kiiwa
dog.NOM rice eat-IND QM say.PAST
`The dog said "I eat rice."'

mam2 balla-gen 5huwa bat ka-n2wa d2 ki2la
1SG.NOM dog-ABL ask.PST rice eat-IND Q QM
`I asked the dog whether he eats rice`

Other verbs QM works with are shouted, requested, was worried, muttered, promised, doubted, believed

You will need to specify the position classes for the verbal morphology in the Morphology section. You will need to specify which verbs can take which type of complement in the Lexicon section.

Adverbial Clausal Modifiers
---------------------------

Subordination occurs through verbal endings,
inflectional form plus particles, and case markers.

-ddi "while" attaches directly to verb root for unspecified time
balla uya-ddi mam2 patt2ree bal2-n2wa
balla cook-while ma-m2 newspaper read-IND
`While the dog is cooking, I read a newspaper`

particle ko12 (while/when) for time as well

-ham2 verb ending + PST

The tense of the unspecified temporal clauses in (78) is determined by the tense term
of the main clause. (a:198 examples)

gama4 (while/as soon as)
while - if subordinate clause is non-past tense
as soon as - if subordinate clause is past tense
(examples a:199)

All examples are showing the subordinate clause PRECEDES the regular clause

Clauses of cause and reason are mainly formed with case markers and inflection plus particles
hinda or nisaa. The case forms include the dative -12
and the instrumental/ablative -in which are suffixed to the past or non--past form of
the subordinate verb. (both tenses for both suffixes)
The particles occur with past or non-past adjectival forms of the verb.

Case on the VERB

oyaa gee sudd2 k2r2-n2wa-12 eyaa gewa-nn2 oon5
you house clean-IND-DAT he pay-INF must
`He must pay you for your cleaning the house`

ikm2n212 aawa-in no-temi beeruna
quickly come.PAST-INS not-get wet.PP be saved.PAST
`I was able to save myself without getting wet (from rain) since I came hurriedly`

hinda/nisaa - subordinate verb gets inflected for adjectival form if dynamic verb, not stative

Ranjit nidi hinda api kataa k2l-ee n55
Ranjit asleep since we call.PT-Poc no
`Since Ranjit was asleep we didn't call him`

Also the past participle construction to show sequential relation of cause and effect (200)

Not going to bring up ki2la

Also, conditional clauses (if), concession (although), purpose (to, infinitive), proportion, and manner


--------------------
Argument Optionality
--------------------

a:14: (It) may rain by the evening
a:15: (We) didn't buy the things since they were too expensive
a:15 (Let's) talk about this when Ranjit comes
Even if he comes, (we) cannot have the meeting OR having the meeting is impossible???

a:17 Ellipsis - NPs including subject and object as well are often omitted from utterances
First and second pronouns are the most freely deleted subjects

gatta d2
gan-u-wa d2
buy-PST-IND Q
`Did you buy it?`

gatta
gan-u-wa
buy-PST-IND
`I bought it`

aawa, aawa
e-u-wa, e-u-wa
come-PST-IND, come-PST-IND
`She is coming or they are coming`
#`It came / The person (expected) came`

Discourse-predictable constituents need not appear in surface structures for constructional purposes

Sinhala allows deletion of non-nominative elements if they are easily recoverable from context
The so called experiencer-subjects, appear in dative form and are better left unmentioned when They
bear coreference with the speaker (usually sensation and perception)

AM is assertion marker

ba32ginii
ba32gini-i
hungry-AM
`I'm hungry` # To me hungry

siit2lai
sitt2lai
cold-AM
`It's cold / I feel cold` # Cold

wahin2wa
wahi-n2-wa
rain-NPT-IND
`It's raining`

Also verb dropping (mention - but not added)
works with existential or possessive verbs inn2wa and tiyen2wa

n55, taatta ged2r2 n55
no, father home no
`No, father isn't home`

Source b:
pro-drop (null anaphora)
"super pro-drop language"
Arguments may be freely omitted in all argument positions with the exception
of complements of postpositionial phrases
More prevalent in spoken Sinhala
More often than not, they can be omitted
(one example of 259 shows ambiguity, don't think it's simple enough to include)





Lexicon to add!!
----------------
baw2
ki2la
d2
-ddi
-ham2
ko12
-in
hinda
nissa
.ADJ?
pit page -u
aliya elephant masc
hon32w5l-2 (inanim) trunk
kalisa4 slacks
andi = wear

n5dd2 = no.Q ???

Adjectival form follows NPT and applies nothing?

PAST
gatta (stem is gan) - so gan-u-wa ?
k55wa k55-wa (stem is ka) - so ka-u-wa ?
dunna -> dun-u-wa ?
diwwa -> di-u-wa
aawa aa-wa -> aa-u-wa
5huwa -> 5h-u-wa
bal2wa bal2-wa -> bal2-u-wa
kiiwa -> ki-u-wa

INVOL  - maybe INVOLs have no? IND, and then different PST rules
5he-n2wa (hear)
diun-a (run)
n51un-a (dance)
k5dun-a (break)


PP
gihilla (ya)
5hila (hear.INV.PP)

ka-laa -> ka-la
gihilla -> ya-la
5hila -> 5he-la


la = PP (involitive trans & vol both)
laa = PAST (vol both for now)



Write up notes:
Adverbial Clausal Modifiers:
- more examples of while/as soon as/before until etc - didn't include this because they're extra and not enough time

TO FIX:
- vase ending doesn't match any listed
