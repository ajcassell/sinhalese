Lab 4 Updates to be made:
-------------------------

1. get clausal complements working
2. get adverbial modifiers working
3. get coordination working (MAYBE comment out VP asyndetonic for now..)
4. If time, update case-constraints-pc to be one pc instead

--------------------------
TDL edits to be made:
--------------------------

1. Coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic. (Check if that is also allowed.)
2. We also will need something that says that adjectives
cannot modify pronouns which will need to be done in TDL editing with a
[ PRON bool ] feature and have the adjectives require their MOD to be
[ PRON - ] while the pronouns say that they are [ PRON + ].

----------------------------
Translation Steps:
----------------------------
1. Find translations for allow of the words in eng.txt
2. Translate first 3 sentences and put at end of testsuite
3. Create sin.txt with the sentences
4. Attempt translation - look at MRS
5. Run test corpus and testsuite

Adverbial Complements
----------------------
* should get one working at a time!
* requires rethinking where FORM comes into play
EMB: "Then you need to rework where [ FORM fin ] comes in for the other forms (i.e. not have have the past tense rule itself put it there). As step one, I suggest taking [ FORM fin ] off the past tense rule. Then see if you can get the [ FORM while ] examples parsing. Then consider whether & how to put [ FORM fin ] back in."
- took FORM fin off past-tense Rules
- made tense-pc optional
- PARSES but with coordination OR PP on balla kaddi mam2 when mam2 shouldn't be included.
- Unification errored on S (balla kaddi) because of SYNSEM LOCAL CONT HCONS APPEND REST FIRST LAST END-LIST null vs cons .. after unifying S (basic-head-opt-comp-phrase) into while rule
.. What does that mean?
-ddi --> attaches directly to verb stem
-ham2 --> PST
nissa/hinda --> NPT or PST plus ADJ (adjectival mood)
EMB:
"1) Yes, add adj-verb to the mood-pc as a non-affixing verb. (Is it really "adjectival"? That seems odd. Maybe adjunct?)
2) Create a value of FORM adj-form, subtype of infinitival.
3) Make the actual mood affixes say [ FORM finite ] and the zero rule say [ FORM adj-form ].
4) Have the subordinator morpheme require [ TENSE non-past ] and [ FROM adj-form ]."
- ^ did all of those things
- made mood class OBLIGATORY (nevermind no I didn't)
- ^ because of this, thinking adjectival will apply to anything that doesn't have a suffix.... which might not be totally accurate
**
Adjectival form - verbs are inflected into non-finite forms through non-finite or connective suffixes
which include the adjectival form, the focus form, conditional, concession, and temporal (ddi), etc etc etc
-- just all examples of non-finite form endings.
--- so rethinking adjectival should not be a mood, but rather another tense?.. whatever it is, it SHOULD be represented accurately by -n2 (and -2)
^ I made adjectival-pst and adjectival-npt rules on tense

** Concerning that asyndetonic coordination example showed while-rule even though -ham2 and -ddi were not present...
- PP is above the coordinated S-T.... how does it get that?

-- I removed asyndetonic VPs and S CMS3 (for now until TDL, still can't handle coord ex 1 -- was working when it was there, but not correctly ^)
^ overgeneration cut in half though! and no longer examples with 1000s of parses

Questions
----------------------

1.  I am wondering if there is an obvious way to see that the CMS is working
in the parse chart. With the embedded complements, we see CP and Cs but with
adverbial modifiers, do we just have to look at the rules applied or is there
a specific rule we should be looking at?
