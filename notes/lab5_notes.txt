Lab 4 Updates to be made:
-------------------------

1. get clausal complements working
2. get adverbial modifiers working
3. get coordination working (MAYBE comment out VP asyndetonic for now..)
4. If time, update case-constraints-pc to be one pc instead

--------------------------
TDL edits to be made:
--------------------------

1. Coordination on VPs and S which we called
participle coordination. The matrix cannot specify
specific inflected forms of the verb constituents in the
coordination, so we will need to manually add this into
the TDL files somehow later. For now it is marked as
asyndetonic. (Check if that is also allowed.)
2. We also will need something that says that adjectives
cannot modify pronouns which will need to be done in TDL editing with a
[ PRON bool ] feature and have the adjectives require their MOD to be
[ PRON - ] while the pronouns say that they are [ PRON + ].

----------------------------
Translation Steps:
----------------------------
1. Find translations for allow of the words in eng.txt
2. Translate first 3 sentences and put at end of testsuite
3. Create sin.txt with the sentences
4. Attempt translation - look at MRS
5. Run test corpus and testsuite
