Questions about the affixes on verbs in all combinations and not correct ones
- tense is not obligatory

oyaa has case acc case for one of them

ma-m2 doesn't take nominative when it should
ma by itself


d2 and both negators - does that mean negation isn't adding the semantics properly


how to look at MMT MRS??


QUESTIONS:

1. sentence #3 oyaa (2sg) is becoming oyaala (makes sense) and eyaala (does not make sense). Is this like
how Spanish has 3pl "you all"?







-----
mood and tense pc are not obligatory so it's allowing

subj-head-phrase :+ decl-head-subj-phrase & head-final-head-nexus &
 [ NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun & [ CASE nom ] ].

nominal predicates can be any case but realistically should be nominative
which we already ruled out to be just nom_acc
(head-subj for adjectives and the non-head in a non-verbal predicate pairing)

-- DID ---

added tense and mood flags and copied up the inflections everywhere except for while-modifier
and then neg-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-with-pred &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.ICONS-KEY focus,
                                             CAT.HEAD.FORM finite ],
    INFLECTED [ TENSE-PC-FLAG +,
                MOOD-PC-FLAG + ] ].

pred-lex-rule := infl-lex-rule & pred-pc-lex-rule-super & stative-pred-lex-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD [ MOD < >,
                              PRD -],
		       VAL [ SUBJ < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD noun & [ CASE nom ]] ] > ] ] ].

           added CASE nom

-e focus doesn't change the semantics.. it's just another mood with no restrictions on being affixed

commented out 1sg-pronoun nominative rule
;nominative-pronoun-suffix :=
;%suffix (* -m2)
;nominative-pronoun-lex-rule.
got rid of -m2 for 1sg pronoun so that it behaved like all other pronouns and nouns, not an exception

took off mood-pc-dtr and tense-pc-dtr from aux-lex and put it directly onto the past-part-aux
since that's the only one using it and that way neg-aux isn't ALLOWED to have mood and tense
because it was adding them anyway optionally.
