Questions about the affixes on verbs in all combinations and not correct ones
- tense is not obligatory

oyaa has case acc case for one of them

ma-m2 doesn't take nominative when it should
ma by itself


d2 and both negators - does that mean negation isn't adding the semantics properly


how to look at MMT MRS??





-----
mood and tense pc are not obligatory so it's allowing

subj-head-phrase :+ decl-head-subj-phrase & head-final-head-nexus &
 [ NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun & [ CASE nom ] ].

nominal predicates can be any case but realistically should be nominative
which we already ruled out to be just nom_acc
(head-subj for adjectives and the non-head in a non-verbal predicate pairing)
