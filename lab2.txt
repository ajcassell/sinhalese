Melody Bechler, Alexandra Cassell

Our language has several non-ASCII characters. We have assigned numbers to these characters as
follows: ṭ = 1, ə = 2, ɖ = 3.

Please note the source, vetted, and phenomena fields have been left out of the provided examples below
for the sole purpose of space. They remain in the testsuite file. Also, the example numbers match those in
the testsuite.

One more note about submission - the tsdb/home shows a package which I think is what was expected
for the results of tsdb. In the results file it looks like there was only 39 instances if I'm reading
correctly, but I kept rerunning and regenerating this package with 48 examples. Hopefully,
I am misunderstanding something. 

1./2. Below are descriptions of the phenomena seen in Sinhalese. These include the word order, noun casing,
structure of WH-questions, the use of quantifiers, and a few options for verb aspect.

Word order in Sinhalese is free word order, although the natural word order is commonly SOV. To capture
free word order in the testsuite, we included each of the six possible word orders, all of which are grammatical.
Our resource show that colloquial Sinhalese tends towards the SOV order but that the other 5 forms cannot be
ruled ungrammatical so we have chosen to follow free word order, with preference for SOV. The following is
one example of SOV. The rest can be found in the testsuite. Sinhalese also includes auxiliary verbs and
these have fixed word order following the main verb shown in example 7 below, whereas example 8 is ungrammatical.

# 1 SOV Word Order
Judgement: g
dalla bat kan2wa
dalla bat ka-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-IND
`The dog eats the rice`

# 7 AUX following verb
Judgement: g
dalla bat kalaa tiyen2wa
dalla bat ka-laa tiyen2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP has
`The dog has eaten the rice`

# 8 AUX preceding verb
Judgement: u
dalla bat tiyen2wa kalaa
dalla bat tiyen2wa ka-laa
dog.NOM rice.NOM has eat-PP
`The dog has eaten the rice`

To model word order in the customization matrix, we chose free word order and included auxiliaries
that appear after the verb. We noted there can be more than one auxiliary in a clause and the
complements of auxiliaries are saturated sentences.

In Sinhalese, number includes singular and plural. There are first, second, and third persons and
there are four genders in this language: animate, inanimate, feminine, and masculine. Feminine and masculine
are subtypes of animate. Second person pronouns have three variations depending on level of respect
(vulgar, ordinary, respect) which are mentioned at the end of this write-up. Examples of 1pl and 3sg are below
but the other 4 can be found in the testsuite.

# 1 1pl personal pronoun
Judgement: g
api bat kan2wa
api bat ka-n2wa
We rice.NOM eat-IND
`We eat rice`

# 3 3sg personal pronoun
Judgement: g
eyaa bat kan2wa
eyaa bat ka-n2wa
She/he/it rice.NOM eat-IND
`She/he/it eats rice`

To model this in the matrix, we added singular (number1) and plural (number2) for number. For person,
we chose first, second, and third, with no subtypes distinguished in the first person.
We added two gender supertypes: animate and inanimate. Masculine and feminine are subtypes of the animate gender only.
Our resources briefly mention the distinction between animate and inanimate, along with masculine and feminine as
animate subtypes, but they do not provide concrete examples regarding usage. Therefore, we have not yet included
any examples in the testsuite.

In Sinhalese, there are 6 cases: nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental/ablative, genitive/locative, and vocative.
Grammatical relations do not determine case in this language. Instead, lexical and semantic principles such as definiteness,
animacy, volitivity, and semantic roles determine case. When a subject acts as an experiencer, the dative case is
required on the subject, but dative case is only found on animate arguments with involitive verb stems.
Inanimates may only be marked with nominative case on S arguments, rendering examples like #6 below ungrammatical.
Genitive is imperative when indicating possession. Examples such as #7 and #8 below reflect this as the use of
nominative makes #8 ungrammatical. Case is considered a Split-S system in this language.

# 3 Dative case subject, involitive verb
Judgement: g
ma12 sindu æhen2wa
ma-12 sindu æhe-n2wa
I.1sg-DAT music.NOM hear.INVOL-IMPF
`I hear music`

# 6 Accusative subject, involitive verb (inanimates can only be marked with nominative case)
Judgement: u
malbandunaw2 kæduna
malbanduna-w2 kædun-a
vase.SG.DEF-ACC break.INVOL-PST
`The vase broke`

#7 Genitive/Locative
Judgement: g
war2d2 mage atee
war2d2 ma-ge at-ee
fault I-GEN hand-LOC
`The fault lies with me`

#8 Genitive/Locative - incorrect, missing GEN on pronoun (indicates possession)
Judgement: u
war2d2 mam2 atee
war2d2 ma-m2 at-ee
fault I-NOM hand-LOC
`The fault lies with me`

To capture this, we chose split-S in the customization system, stating A takes nominative while O
takes accusative. Additionally, we added four additional cases: genitive, vocative, instrumental, and dative.
Within the lexicon, we stored these cases within the noun supertypes and subtypes. Thus, there are noun types
for each case that we found noun examples for, as well as pronoun subtypes for different cases since Sinhalese
pronouns vary in case the same way common nouns do. We also created a transitive verb type that takes a
dative subject instead of accusative, but this is not configured yet correctly.

Sinhalese does not use separate words for determiners. Instead, there are affixes to represent
indefiniteness. However, this language uses plural quantifiers like ‘keep2yak’ and ‘sam2harak’ to
express incomplete or indefinite quantities, like ‘several’ and ‘some’, respectively.
‘Keep2yak’ can only be used with inanimate nouns. If ‘keep2yak’ is used with animate nouns,
it must be used with animate classifiers such as ‘denaa’ or ‘denek’. Both ‘keep2yak’ and ‘sam2harak’
generally follow plural common nouns. One exception to this is ‘sam2harak’ which may precede a common
plural noun. An example of this is shown below.

# 2 Quantifier "some" follows plural noun
Judgement: g
mam2 pot sam2harak gatta
ma-m2 pot sam2harak gatta
I-NOM book.PL some buy.PAST
`I bought some books`

# 3 Quantifier "some" precedes plural noun
Judgement: g
mam2 sam2harak pot gatta
ma-m2 sam2harak pot gatta
I-NOM some book.PL buy.PAST
`I bought some books`

In the customization matrix, we chose to add a type under determiner called ‘quantifier’.
We then added both ‘keep2yak’ and ‘sam2harak’ as stems under quantifier (det1).

The phenomena "Direct Inverse" is not applicable to Sinhalese.

3. So far, we have not implemented WH-questions, binary yes-or-no questions and tense/aspect in the customization system.
Sinhalese verbs inflect for non-past and past tense. They are composed of a stem and inflectional suffixes.
For example, ‘kan2wa’ (eat) is composed of the stem ‘ka’ and two inflectional suffixes, ‘n2’ for non-past tense
followed by ‘wa’ for indicative form. Additionally, verbs are assigned three types: active, passive, and causative.
All verbs belong to at least one of these types, while some verbs may belong to more. All verbs in the passive
type are intransitive, while verbs in the active type can be transitive and intransitive. The transitive verb
type includes: ‘ka’ (eat), ‘gatta’ (buy), ‘kan2wa’ (eat), ‘atee’ (lies), and ‘gann2wa’ (buy). The intransitive
verb type includes: ‘ya’ (go) and ‘yanne’ (go). We also created a unique transitive-verb-dative-subject
category that captures the existence of verbs that co-occur with a dative subject. This includes ‘æhen2wa’ (hear).
This is a unique subject verb case pattern and it can only occur with animate arguments with an involitive
verb stem as shown in the two testsuite examples below.

# 3 Dative case subject, involitive verb
Judgement: g
ma12 sindu æhen2wa
ma-12 sindu æhe-n2wa
I.1sg-DAT music.NOM hear.INVOL-IMPF
`I hear music`

# 4 Dative case subject, involitive verb (incorrect case subject, dative only on animate args with involitive verb stem)
Judgement: u
malbanduna12 sindu æhen2wa
malbanduna-12 sindu æhe-n2wa
vase.SG-DAT music.NOM hear.INVOL-IMPF
`The vase hears music`

Sinhala has two tenses: past and non-past. Non-past includes both present or future and is expressed with the standard
verb form/stem. Past tense is expressed using inflectional forms depending on conjugation.

# 3 non-past tense
Judgement: g
dalla bat kan2wa
dalla bat ka-n2-wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The dog eats rice`

# 5 past tense
Judgement: g
dalla bat kææwa
dalla bat kææwa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat.PST
`The dog ate rice`

In addition to past/non-past tenses, Sinhala has seven aspects: perfective, completive, inchoative,
processive, progressive, inceptive, and resultative but we chose to limit these, per recommendation,
to just perfective and completive (perceived future completion) in our testsuite.  Perfective aspect is
expressed using a perfect participle along with the auxiliary ‘tien2wa’, meaning ‘be’.
Completive aspect represents perceived completion of an action. This aspect occurs only with active verbs,
therefore inactive involitive verbs will not occur in the completive aspect. Below are the respective two examples.

# 1 Perfective Aspect
Judgement: g
dalla bat kalaa tien2wa
dalla bat ka-laa tie-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP be-IND
`The dog has eaten the rice`

# 2 Completive Aspect (perceived completion, like in the future), daa is an aux
Judgement: g
dalla bat kalaa daan2wa
dalla bat ka-laa daa-n2wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-PP daa-IND
`The dog will eat the rice completely`

Tense and aspect were not added to the starter grammar this week, other than defining in
the customization system that our language has finite/non-finite FORM distinction.

We also included question verb types in our testsuite (and the lexicon). ‘Kohed2’ (where) specifies place and ‘kaud2’
(who) specifies a thing, and ‘d2’ is the interrogative/question marker. Interrogative words are generally
sentence-initial, but Sinhala’s free word order allows for optional movement. 'Kohed2' and 'kaud2' are in fact the roots
for 'where' and 'who' with the 'd2' question affix making the phrase a sentence. These words were added to the lexicon
in the customization system, but no options were selected for them so they are not yet generating parses.

In Sinhalese, yes-no questions are formed by adding ‘d2’, a question particle, to the sentence-final position of declarative sentences.
This is exhibited in the following example:

# 3 Yes-or-no question constituent, no focus shift
Judgement: g
mam2 ka3eet2 yan2wa d2
ma-m2 ka3ee-t2 ya-n2-wa d2
I-NOM shop-DAT go-NPT-IND Q
`Do I go to the shop?`

When using an interrogative, questions adhere to a focus sentence pattern. A focus marker ‘-e’ is added to the verbal predicate
to reflect a focused sentence pattern. The question marker ‘d2’ is also added. Additionally, the interrogative
can be sentence-final or sentence-initial position as a result of Sinhala’s free word order. The two examples
below exhibit the focal marker added to the verbal predicate, the question marker on the interrogative, and both the
sentence-initial and sentence-final interrogative variations.

# 6 WH-question, with focus shift
Judgement: g
bat kanne kaud2
bat ka-nn-e kau-d2
rice.NOM eat-NPT-FOC who-Q
`Who eats rice?`

# 7 WH-question, sentence-initial, with focus shift
Judgement: g
kaud2 bat kanne
kau-d2 bat ka-nn-e
who-Q rice.NOM eat-NPT-FOC
`Who eats rice?`

These yes/no and wh-questions were not added to the starter grammar this week. The concept of focus is also
seen elsewhere in our resources so will require more investigating.

4. Our grammar thus far achieves a coverage of 50% over our 48 testsuite example sentences which accounts for
19 of those examples.

18 out of the 19 sentences that were parsed result in two readings, each of which are identical other than a
VP node being swapped for a V node. The other constituents of the parse remain the same. It is our guess
that this is due to something in the customization matrix and how the starter grammar rules were created.
For example the sentence below produces the following two parses.
dalla bat kan2wa
dalla bat ka-n2-wa
dog.NOM rice.NOM eat-NPT-IND
`The dog eats rice`

[S [NP [N [dalla]]] [V [NP [N [bat]]] V [kan2wa]]]
[S [NP [N [dalla]]] [VP [NP [N [bat]]] V [kan2wa]]]

The one sentence that resulted in a unique singular reading was the following:
dalla kohed2
dalla kohe-d2
dog.NOM where-Q
`Where is the dog?`

Our assumption for this producing a singular result is the lack of verb present
in the sentence. Sinhalese does not require an existence verb like "is" in English in
both declarative and interrogative phrases. Consequentially, there is no VP or V
in the parse for this sentence, which rules out the reasoning for double parses
mentioned above.

The first sentence that did not parse is:
mam2 ma12 pot2 gatta
ma-m2 ma-12 pot2 gatta
I.1sg-NOM I.1sg-DAT book.NOM buy.PAST
`I bought the book for me`
The parse chart shows that that "pot2 gatta" becomes a constituent but the subject
I and the dative I (recipient of the object) are not accounted for. We believe
this has to do with how the dative case is set up in our grammar. We have added
dative as a case type in our grammar customization but in no other rules or lexical
types do we define how dative case nouns are found in a grammatical sentence.

Other sentences that did not product a parse are due to the lexicon not containing
every entry in our testsuite. We managed to include the majority of the lexical
items, including varying cases on nouns and pronouns but missed a few. Words in
our testsuite that were not included are "mage" (line 261), "atwe" (line 281),
"me" (lines 291, 301, 311) so 5 examples were not potentially parsed because of this miss.

All (6) but 1 of our WH-question examples was not parsed. Looking through the
parse charts individually, the noun and verb constituents are always joined into
an S consitutent. However, the question word (kaud2 or kohed2) or the question marker
(d2) are isolated and not able to play a role in the sentence parsing. This is
because we did not describe the WH-question functionality in the grammar
customization step. This does not explain why the unique parsing for "dalla kohed2",
mentioned above was able to parse.

We did not include the auxiliary "tiyen2wa" in our lexicon yet, so the sentence
examples #7 and #8 in the Word Order section of our test suite were not parsed.

It is also important to note that although we only have 50% coverage, no
ungrammatical sentences in the testsuite were inaccurately parsed.

Our grammar achieves a 10.0% overgeneration rate.

5. So far, we have not found anything in the customization system that seems unable to cope with the properties of
our language. However, we did have difficulties with the case system of our language. We have hypothesized
Sinhalese as a Split-S language where the standard transitive relationship is nominative-accusative
but then also the instances of dative-subject verb argument structures when the verb is of an
involuntary type such that the subject is experiencing something, even though this is not visible in the English translation.
For example, our sentence below shows the involuntary verb hear in the sense that the sound is like the subject and the hearer
is the experiencer:
ma12 sindu æhen2wa
ma-12 sindu æhe-n2wa
I.1sg-DAT music.NOM hear.INVOL-IMPF
`I hear music`
This example was mentioned previously with regards to case but we are re-exploring it here to indicate that we
are unsure how to use the customization system to account for dative subjects. The constraint options in the
system did not allow for constraints on the subject's case. If this option exists, we were unable to find
it and include it in this first pass of grammar generation.

Another limitation (as far as we can tell) regards the pronouns. Sinhalese has multiple varieties of
second person personal pronouns. These include the ordinary form, a respect form, and a vulgar form.
We included the ordinary form in our lexicon and lexical types for personal pronouns, but are unsure
how and when to include these varying degrees of respect when addressing the second person.
